{"jutsu_name":"Animal Cursed Seal","jutsu_type":"Kinjutsu, Juinjutsu, Senjutsu","jutsu_description":"This is a unique cursed seal applied by Orochimaru, still in its experimental stages, and therefore was incomplete and unstable.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n\n1.1 Acquisition\n\n1.1.1 Ingredients\n\n\n1.2 Appearance\n1.3 Powers\n\n\n2 Drawbacks\n3 Trivia\n\n\nOverview[]\nAcquisition[]\nWhile every other one of Orochimaru's Juinjutsu are directly given by him through a bite, acquisition for this one differs in that the chosen person would be bitten by a snake, which will give them instructions in the form of a tattoo on how to form the potion that grants the user a seal. As with any cursed seal, the chosen person would faint upon acquiring the seal from apparent pain.\nThis cursed seal is not the source of its power; rather, it serves as a blueprint to create a potion that will grant the drinker power akin to an actual cursed seal. Said potion consists of genetic information of animals which would be combined with the drinker's body to release an explosive amount of power.\nThe ingredients may be found in the Nara clan's laboratory, which is hidden deep within the mountains. The potion can then be formed in a secret room in a mountainous cavern: ingredients are placed and mixed on a giant tablet matching that of the tattoo. Tsunade believed that no ordinary shinobi would be able to copy the method of this mixture, and that the skills of an artisan would be required.\n\nIngredients[]\n\n\n\nChinese licorice (甘草, Kanzō)\nCinnamomi cortex (桂皮, Keihi)\nDeer antlers (鹿の角, Shika no tsuno)\nRehmanniae radix (地黃, Jiō)\nCaryophylli flos (丁子, Chōji)\nGinseng radix (人参, Ninjin)\nSea dragon (海馬, Kaiba)\nCurcumae rhizema (鬱金, Ukon)\n\n\nPaeoniae radix (芍藥, Shakuyaku)\nCistanchis herba (肉蓯蓉, Nikujuyō)\nAgkistrodon japonicae (反鼻, Hanpi)\nLinderae umbellatae Ramus (烏樟, Ushō)\nEpimedii herba (淫羊藿, In'yōkaku)\nSaposhnikoviae radix (防風, Bōfū)\nViper (蝮, Mamushi)\nDried lizard (干蜥蜴, Hitokage)\n\nAppearance[]\nThe cursed seal is reminiscent of a green skull, with an open jaw. The inside, however, consists of various ducts and slots, leading to a bottom slot at the \"jaw\". By activating several hand seals, the ingredient names will appear in the corresponding slot sections of the seal. The seal is applied onto Mizuki's right forearm.\nWhile the potion ingredients are grounded into liquid and poured into their respective slots, they each have a different colour. However, when all of them are mixed together into the potion itself, the colour becomes a glowing crimson, similar to when the cursed seals activate and spread across a person's body.\n\nPowers[]\nWhen the ingredients are formed into the potion and then ingested, the user will go into the first stage of the cursed seal and obtain enhanced abilities along with muscle growth and, in Mizuki's case with his tiger-like stripes, traits of an animal. With his strengthened muscles, he was able to smash his opponents through solid ground and throw them to great distances. He also gained tremendous increase in speed, allowing him to overrun both Naruto Uzumaki and Iruka Umino with ease, appearing as a barely visible blur whenever he moved. Iruka also noted that Mizuki's chakra levels rose drastically.\nWhen the second level is reached, the user will gain specific characteristics of the animal, along with immense increases in their strength and abilities. Since Mizuki added the extracts of a tiger to the mix, he transformed into a bipedal tiger, with increase in strength, but a great drop in speed and sharpness in his attacks.\nUnique as this cursed seal is, even the markings gained differs from the typical ones: this seal's first stage does not spread in a pattern across the user's body, but instead gives Mizuki stripes on his arms and face alone; the second stage does not give him a beige-skin mutation, but instead a bipedal-animal form.\n\nDrawbacks[]\n     Mizuki's cells destroyed by the incomplete potion, and being stabilised by Kitō.  \nAs the potion was an incomplete experiment, the effects are only temporary. Because the sudden burst of power places a huge burden on the cells, far beyond a body's limit, and the results will backfire, destroying the user's body.\nFor Mizuki's case, the potion was incomplete when he drank it, so when the effects dissipated, he shrivelled up into a malnourished and powerless old man, and would have died if not for Tsunade's medical skills. Regardless, Mizuki lost all of his powers and could never be a ninja again.\n\nTrivia[]\nThe hidden room where the ingredients can be processed is locked behind a boulder which will recede if a kunai is inserted into a slot in front. The stone table required to mix the ingredients is hidden under the stone floor, which requires a hidden chain switch, underneath the eighth wall tile on the right side from the entrance, to be pulled, to trigger the hydraulics to open the trapdoor and elevate the table.\nIn Naruto Mobile, when entering the second level of the seal, Mizuki releases a stream of red chakra throughout his body, similar to the Jinchūriki's chakra cloak, increasing his speed and attacks."}

{"jutsu_name":"Delicate Illness Extraction Technique","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Medical Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"When a person has been afflicted by a pathogen or toxin, this medical ninjutsu can be used to draw out the agent and heal the damage. The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra. Then, using a chakra scalpel, an incision is made near the affected part. Using their chakra, the medical-nin pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision. The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body. This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison. The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work. As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency. This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate. To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.\nAfter the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed. This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery. This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched chakra control. Therefore, it is considered an extremely difficult technique, even among medical-nin.\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, Sarada Uchiha, Inojin Yamanaka, Wasabi Izuno, Dōshu Goetsu, Hako Kuroi, and Iwabee Yuino were each taught the basics of this Antidote Jutsu.[2]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 256\n\n↑ Boruto episode 152"}

{"jutsu_name":"Dead Demon Consuming Seal","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Fūinjutsu, Kinjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Dead Demon Consuming Seal is a sealing technique developed by the Uzumaki clan to call upon the power of the Shinigami.[2] Its very existence is so secret that even Orochimaru knew nothing about it.[1]\n\nOverview[]\nAfter the hand seals are performed, the user's soul is partly separated from their body and suspended behind them. Behind their soul appears the Shinigami, which restrains their soul with its hair. Only the summoner is able to see the Shinigami at this point. After a few moments,[3] the Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants unintelligibly until a cursed seal appears on its arm. It then drives its arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul.[1] When Hiruzen Sarutobi performs it, he is required to get close to his target in order to initiate the seal.[3] When Minato Namikaze performs it, he is able to remain at a distance.[4] Targets are able to see the Shinigami so long as it's in contact with their soul.[5]\nWhile the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any jutsu they may be using are dispelled,[3] and they are prevented from performing additional jutsu.[5] With targets unable to escape or fight back, the summoner can remove and seal their soul. Hiruzen was able to seal multiple souls by using this technique in conjunction with the Shadow Clone Technique.[3] The sealing, however, is not necessarily complete nor automatic:\n\nWhen Minato uses it, he seals only the Nine-Tails' yin chakra, leaving its yang chakra alone.[6]\nWhen Hiruzen used it on Orochimaru, he had to rely on his own physical strength to extract Orochimaru's soul.[5] Because he lacked the strength to fully remove it,[7] he opted instead to only seal Orochimaru's arms, accomplished by having the Shinigami cut off the arms of Orochimaru's soul.[8]\nThe target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their torso that is similar in appearance to the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.[3] In Minato's case, this sealing of the Nine-Tails' yin chakra into himself makes him its jinchūriki.[9] With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul.[8] The summoner can, with difficulty, continue moving and speaking, allowing them to finish any lingering business they may have, but they will die as soon as their soul has been fully consumed.[4] The souls of the summoner and their victim do not pass on to the Pure Land,[10] instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity.[5]\nAlthough Orochimaru survives the sealing of his arms, his arms are paralysed, causing them to hang uselessly at his sides. This prevents him from performing hand seals and by extension most ninjutsu.[8] With time, he's able to regain limited use of the arms, but he's still left with a constant and extreme pain.[11] Orochimaru believes that Tsunade could heal his arms - something Tsunade does not deny - but she refuses to help him.[12] Ultimately, after his arms begin to rot, Orochimaru is forced to switch bodies or risk death.[13] He is able to make better use of the new body's arms,[14] but the jutsu he can use remain limited so long as his soul's arms are sealed within the Shinigami.[15]\n\n    Souls being released from the Shinigami's stomach.  \nSouls can only be freed from the Shinigami's stomach by using Dead Demon Consuming Seal: Release (屍鬼封尽・解, Shiki Fūjin: Kai, English TV: Reaper Death Seal: Release). To use, an individual wears the Shinigami Mask, causing them to become possessed by the Shinigami. If the individual wearing the mask slices open their own stomach, the Shinigami will do the same, and any souls inside it will be freed. However, the mask doesn't have any properties that will prevent its user from dying of that injury; when Orochimaru uses this to restore his arms, he survives the injury by switching bodies once again. With the other souls he frees from the Shinigami, Orochimaru is able to use the Impure World Reincarnation.[15]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe full name of this technique is \"Sealing Technique: Dead Demon Consuming Seal\" (封印術・屍鬼封尽, Fūinjutsu: Shiki Fūjin).\nTō no Sho lists the Dead Demon Consuming Seal as having a range of up to five meters.[1] When Minato uses it against the Nine-Tails, he does so from significantly further away.[4]\nDuring his discussion with Kushina on how to deal with the Nine-Tails, Minato stated: \"The fūinjutsu I — not being a jinchūriki — am able to use is… the Dead Demon Consuming Seal!\" (「人柱力でないオレができる封印術は屍鬼封尽!」, \"Jinchūriki denai ore ga dekiru fūinjutsu wa Shiki Fūjin!\").[6] What he meant by this is unclear.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Tō no Sho, page 228\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 619, page 2\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 Naruto chapter 123\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 Naruto chapter 504\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 Naruto chapter 124\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 503, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 136\n\n↑ 8.0 8.1 8.2 Naruto chapter 137\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 631\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 520, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 153\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 155\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 198, pages 15-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 295\n\n↑ 15.0 15.1 Naruto chapter 618"}

Once mastered, users can strike targets from far greater distances than they could if simply throwing a kunai.

{"jutsu_name":"Living Corpse Reincarnation","jutsu_type":"Kinjutsu, Ninjutsu, Reincarnation Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Living Corpse Reincarnation is a technique that was developed by Orochimaru that allows him to transfer his soul to someone else's body. It is also referred to as the \"Eternal Youth and Immortality Technique\". It was developed in order to fuel his dream of acquiring all the knowledge in existence, a feat that cannot be achieved in a single lifetime.\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Known Hosts or Candidates\n\n2.1 Hosts\n2.2 Candidates\n\n\n3 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nThe Living Corpse Reincarnation immortalises one's mind, transferring it to a stronger body before the current host rots. By repeating this process periodically, this effectively allows the user to remain in the realm of living, so long as they can keep the host body alive while residing within.\nOrochimaru can only perform this technique once every three years. It also seems that when the three years are almost over, he is forced to move into another host, as the previous one begins to weaken and reject him. Presumably, if he had a proper container, he could stay in the host for a full lifetime. The fact that he wanted to prepare Sasuke Uchiha and Kimimaro for the transfer before performing it reinforces this.\nTo perform this technique, Orochimaru reveals his true form: a gigantic white snake composed of smaller white snakes, by abandoning his current host's body. Orochimaru then swallows the new host and takes him or her to a separate, mental plane where he envelops the mind of his victim. The snake body then dies and falls apart, and Orochimaru's soul dominates the body (though the Sharingan seems to be able to reverse the process against Orochimaru, which also grants the host Orochimaru's supply of chakra and powers). The souls of the hosts are kept alive within Orochimaru, leaving them \"still alive\", in a sense (albeit suppressed), and when Orochimaru switches hosts, the souls leave with him. Apparently if the host of these souls' chakra level falls enough it is possible for them to resurface in material form as seen with Orochimaru surfacing with his Eight Branches Technique after Sasuke used up most of his chakra.\nAfter taking over another body, Orochimaru modifies it to suit his theme of snakes, in order to increase his survival capabilities, such as stretching and bending his body, reconnecting any severed parts, and shedding his skin to heal injuries. This ensures that if Orochimaru cannot transfer to another body within the three years' time, he can allow his current one to greatly heal and evade attacks, rendering it virtually immortal; Sasuke refers this as the \"Power of the White Snake\" (白蛇の力, Shirohebi no Chikara).[2] Orochimaru also alters the face of his host to look like his original form.\nAfter being revived through the Evil Releasing Method, Orochimaru seemingly circumvented this process, emerging in a slightly different snake form and then slithering into a White Zetsu clone's mouth.[3]\n\nKnown Hosts or Candidates[]\nHosts[]\nUnknown person — when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\nUnknown person — when Orochimaru uses his Living Corpse Reincarnation on Sasuke, another one of his past hosts is seen in Orochimaru and Sasuke's mental plane.\nUnknown female — for replacing the hand Itachi Uchiha severed; left body to escape the effects of his arms being sealed away.\nGen'yūmaru — a desperate temporary replacement body before Sasuke Uchiha; left body for Sasuke Uchiha.\nSasuke Uchiha — after having been absorbed by Sasuke when he reversed his Living Corpse Reincarnation technique, took over due to Itachi's battle with his brother lowering Sasuke's chakra enough for Orochimaru to gain control; was sealed away by Itachi.\nWhite Zetsu Clone — for the cells of Hashirama Senju, as well as to escape the fatal injury of releasing the Dead Demon Consuming Seal.[3]\nCandidates[]\nItachi Uchiha — for the Sharingan; failed due to Orochimaru being unable to defeat him.\nKimimaro — for the Shikotsumyaku; rejected due to terminal disease.\nGuren — for the Crystal Release; rejected due to being too late and loss of interest.(anime only)\nSasuke Uchiha — for the Sharingan; postponed due to being overpowered by Sasuke, then sealed away before another of his consciousnesses was released by the Evil Releasing Method.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Tō no Sho, page 270\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 365, page 8\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 618, page 15"}

Yahiko articulates the guilt she's been feeling, at first causing her to think he is merely a figment of her imagination. When he starts shifting blame to her other friend, Nagato – a sentiment she does not believe is justified – she realises he is a genjutsu. She dispels the field of flowers, revealing a cliff she was about to walk off of, and after discarding her cloak causes Yahiko's image to disappear as well."}

{"jutsu_name":"Transformation Technique","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, General skill","jutsu_description":"The Transformation Technique allows the user to take the appearance of whatever they choose. \n\nOverview[]\nThis technique is most often used to disguise the user as another person, but they can also turn into an animal, plant, or inanimate object;[1] according to Sasuke Retsuden, inanimate objects are the most difficult to transform into, and users are shown familiarising themselves with an object's weight and feel before assuming its form. Users will gain the attributes and physical features of whatever they transform into, such as a weapon's sharpness or an animal's fangs.[2][3] To be able to assume so many different forms makes this technique invaluable for not just combat, but intelligence gathering and diversionary tactics as well.[1] In Sasuke Shinden, some transformations are shown to take some getting used to, such as if the assumed form has a different height than the user or if the assumed form wears clothes that the user isn't accustomed to.\nBeing able to use the Transformation Technique does not necessarily mean one can use it well. Ideally, the user's transformation should be indistinguishable from the original, so that if they were placed together they could not be told apart. Inexperienced users, particularly Academy students, will often have obvious discrepancies in their transformations, making them useless for deception.[1] Even practised users, though their transformations may lack any serious flaws, can overlook small details of whoever they're impersonating (such as minor scrapes or blemishes), thus enabling careful observers to expose them as impostors. Even if a transformation is a perfect likeness, users can still inadvertently reveal themselves if they don't act the same way as their subject.[4] Users can also be identified as fakes if their scent is wrong.[5]\nWhen a transformed user has been found out and attacked, they ordinarily allow the transformation to dispel. Some users may maintain the transformation in a final attempt to keep their cover, only dispelling the transformation once this effort fails.[4] Still other users may, when they seem to be dispelling the transformation, actually take another transformation altogether, confusing opponents as to their true identity. Seemingly the only way to reliably find out if somebody is using the Transformation Technique is to knock them unconscious, which will cause the transformation to dissolve.[6]\nTsunade uses the Transformation Technique to constantly appear several decades younger, keeping it active regardless of where she is or what she's doing. She only reverts to her original form when she no longer has the chakra to maintain her transformation.[7] In the anime, Kagerō also keeps her Transformation Technique active for long periods of time, taking the form of a buck-toothed, hunchbacked man.[8] In Akatsuki Hiden, the citizens of Shangri-la use the Transformation Technique at all times in a concerted effort to make new lives for themselves; their transformations only dispel when they die.\n\nTrivia[]\nHensōjutsu was a real-life ninja skill, where the ninja would assume a false identity in order to blend in with a population and spy.\nWhen Naruto Uzumaki transforms into a fūma shuriken, Sasuke Uchiha is able to tell that it's Naruto as soon as he grabs the shuriken.[9]\nIn Naruto Shippūden the Movie, the Shadow Mirror Body Changing Method permanently changes the user's appearance, with no way to change back.\nIn Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison, Kazan earned the moniker \"Hundred Transformations\" due to his extensive usage of the Transformation Technique.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Rin no Sho, page 220\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 120\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 75\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 46\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 76\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 77\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 171\n\n↑ Naruto episode 138\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 14"}

Through his unprecedented ability to alter targets' perception of time,[3] he uses Tsukuyomi to subject victims to days' worth of torture in a matter of seconds; examples include continual stabbing or reliving traumatic events over and over.[4][5] Tsukuyomi's illusions are usually represented as an inverted grey scale; in the anime, there is usually also a red moon in a red sky. Because of the power of the Mangekyō Sharingan and the speed with which Tsukuyomi works, normal methods of countering genjutsu are ineffective against it.[6]\nUsing Tsukuyomi requires a great deal of chakra, making it inadvisable for Itachi to continue fighting after using it.[6] Like all Mangekyō Sharingan abilities, Tsukuyomi also places strain on Itachi's eyes when performed, blurring his vision.[7] However, victims of Tsukuyomi have it far worse, as they are ordinarily rendered comatose as soon as Tsukuyomi's illusion is completed. Sharingan users can briefly resist unconsciousness,[4] but only particularly skilled Sharingan users can actually break free of Tsukuyomi's influence.[7] Tsunade is the only person known to be capable of healing the psychological damage caused by Tsukuyomi.[8] In Akatsuki Hiden, Itachi theorises that love can be used to revive victims, his reasoning being that, since Tsukuyomi destroys the spirit, feelings that reconnect the spirit can undo Tsukuyomi; Kodaka does indeed do this in order to resuscitate his younger brother, Kiiro.\nAccording to Itachi Shinden: Book of Dark Night, \"the time that passed within this genjutsu was one one-hundredth of one one-thousandth of one one-millionth of that of the real world.\"[9] In the novel, Itachi uses Tsukuyomi on Izumi Uchiha, causing her to live through decades of a happy life in the span of a few moments. When she dies of old age within the illusion, her actual body dies as well.\n\nTrivia[]\nIn Japanese mythology, Tsukuyomi is the god of the Moon, said to have been born when Izanagi, after escaping from the underworld, washed his face and cleaned his right eye. As the Moon god, Tsukuyomi is associated with the passing of time, and at times is cited to be the God of Time (or at least of the calendar).\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Itachi states his intention to use Tsukuyomi on Kabuto Yakushi in order to find out how to stop the Impure World Reincarnation.[10] It's unclear if the genjutsu he ends up using is in fact Tsukuyomi,[11] as such a form of information-gathering is usually done with Genjutsu: Sharingan.\nIn Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, Itachi uses Tsukuyomi by having the red moon crush the opponent while the image of the moon warps into a copy of his Mangekyō Sharingan.\nSee Also[]\nInfinite Tsukuyomi\nKotoamatsukami\nKurama Clan's Kekkei Genkai\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Tō no Sho, pages 252-253\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 389, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 478, page 3\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 142, pages 15-18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 147, page 15\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 257, pages 7-8\n\n↑ 7.0 7.1 Naruto chapter 388, pages 13-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 172, page 15\n\n↑ Taken literally, this means one second of time within Tsukuyomi's illusion is equivalent to 1 x 10-11 seconds of real time.\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 578\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 588"}

Jigen and Kawaki's are red, while Boruto's is blue.\nAfter Amado restored his Kāma, Kawaki has created a rift without activating the Kāma, instead seemingly using it through the Kokugan.\nA White Kāma user cannot use this technique.\nSee Also[]\nKamui\nSasuke Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu\nShin Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu\nYomotsu Hirasaka\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 37, pages 6-9, 40\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 36, pages 20-22\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 39, page 33\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 52, page 38-41"}

{"jutsu_name":"Wind Release: Rasenshuriken","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the ninjutsu. For the episode, see Wind Release: Rasenshuriken!.\n\n\n\n\nThe Wind Release: Rasenshuriken is a shuriken-shaped variant of the Wind Release: Rasengan.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Development\n3 Trivia\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nThe Rasenshuriken was invented by Naruto Uzumaki shortly after he figured out the principles of the Wind Release: Rasengan. Like that technique, Naruto typically has the help of two shadow clones in the Rasenshuriken's formation: he provides the chakra, one clone helps keep the chakra contained, and the second clone adds his wind nature. It is the completed version of the Wind Release: Rasengan, with four large points around the central Rasengan core, giving the appearance of a fūma shuriken. It also gives off a loud screeching noise.[3] By the time of The Last: Naruto the Movie, Naruto is able to create Rasenshuriken without aid and is able to remotely guide it.\nThe Rasenshuriken requires a great deal of chakra to perform. Naruto has been shown creating as many as three Rasenshuriken on his own before tiring out.[4] While in Sage Mode, he can create two Rasenshuriken per transformation.[5] After the second, he must re-enter Sage Mode in order to be able to create additional Rasenshuriken.[6] However, after improving his Sage Mode he's able to use three at a single time (five in the anime),[7] and while in his Kurama Mode or Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, he can use the Rasenshuriken an unlimited number of times. Its four points are very sharp, enough to cut through rock[8] and disintegrate most of Pain's Human Path.[9] The technique is extremely heavy, as Fukasaku was surprised Naruto could throw the highly dense chakra, even in Sage Mode.[10]\n\n     The Rasenshuriken's wind vortex.  \nAfter travelling a certain distance or colliding with a target that it can't slice through, the central sphere of the Rasenshuriken detonates, producing a vortex of wind in the immediate area. Within this vortex, countless microscopic wind blades are created, so many that even the Sharingan can't count them all.[11] The wind blades pierce every cell in the body, disconnecting them from the Chakra circulatory system and so preventing them from providing their physical energy to the chakra-creation process. Because of this, the target loses their ability to create and mould chakra, damage which cannot be healed by medical ninjutsu.[12] Tsunade likens the damage to poison, and warns that if the damage is great enough, those affected by it won't be able to use jutsu again.\n\nDevelopment[]\n     The side effect from using the technique at close range.  \nWhen Naruto first starts using the Rasenshuriken there are two flaws to using it: It was prone to sporadically dissipate after being formed, forcing Naruto to use it as a melee weapon to keep it stable, thrusting the Rasenshuriken into targets in the same way that he does the standard Rasengan.[13] The Rasenshuriken causes cellular damage not only to his targets, but to the arm Naruto holds the Rasenshuriken with, though the damage isn't quite as severe.[14] It, however, poses enough risk for Tsunade to demand it never be used again.[15]\n\n     The Rasenshuriken's expansion.  \nNaruto is able to overcome these flaws by learning senjutsu. By infusing the Rasenshuriken with senjutsu chakra, its shape is maintained after formation, meaning that he can use it as a projectile and, as a result, that he no longer needs to worry about damaging himself. When thrown, the Rasenshuriken travels very quickly, enough to cross the crater of Chibaku Tensei in under a second.[16] Once thrown, Naruto can remotely expand the Rasenshuriken to either compensate for imprecise aim or to catch dodging targets,[17] though its speed is great enough that this is rarely necessary. He enjoys similar benefits while using Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, where he can use his chakra arms to guide the Rasenshuriken to its target while he remains at a safe distance.[18] Moreover, he can use these chakra arms in place of the usual shadow clones.[19]\n\n     Several Rasenshuriken influenced by Naruto's tailed beast chakra.  \nNaruto eventually starts making the Rasenshuriken a template for other jutsu, just as he does with the regular Rasengan. Like the Rasengan, some of the simpler modifications he makes to the Rasenshuriken are by using multiple simultaneously or making them larger (or even smaller). In place of the Rasengan he uses for the centre of the Rasenshuriken, he can use Tailed Beast Balls or Truth-Seeking Balls that will create significantly larger explosions upon detonation. He can also apply other natures to the Rasenshuriken, as he does with the Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken.\n\nTrivia[]\nThough the technique debuted in chapter 339, Naruto used it off-panel six chapters earlier.\nLike the Rasengan, the Rasenshuriken's colour is depicted inconsistently in the series because Masashi Kishimoto has yet to decide upon a colour for the technique.[20] It is most often depicted as being a bluish-white, but different promotional and supplementary material have also shown it as red or orange with no obvious pattern.\nIn Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire, Hiruko tries to absorb this technique, but was unable to combine the peak-levels of shape and nature transformation, like Naruto did at first. The sphere begins forming in his hand, but it becomes unstable and disperses, backfiring on him.\nIn certain games, when the senjutsu version of the Rasenshuriken is thrown, it will hit and carry its target into the air before exploding. This version is referred to as the True: Wind Release: Rasenshuriken (真・風遁・螺旋手裏剣, Shin Fūton: Rasenshuriken).\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Third Databook, pages 298-299\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, pages 290-291\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 339, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 614, pages 9-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 433, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 433, pages 1-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 614\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 442, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 432, pages 6-7\n\n↑ Naruto, chapter 432, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 341, page 18\n\n↑ Naruto, chapter 346, pages 9-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 340, pages 5-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 346, pages 9-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 346, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 442, pages 5-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 432, pages 4-6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 554, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 617, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Second Artbook, page 15"}

Though his is incomplete, Boruto is able to throw it.[9]\n\nTailed Beast Influence[]\nIn the Sasuke Shinden novel, Naruto uses the power of the Nine-Tails to form a Wind Release: Rasengan that he's able to throw; he also doesn't need any shadow clones to create it. When it hits its target, it creates a shockwave of wind away from Naruto. In the anime, Naruto instead uses \"Rasengan: Flash\".\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, Asura Ōtsutsuki developed Amenomihashira, a precursor to this technique.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 321, pages 9-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 329, pages 1-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 330, page 3\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 337\n\n↑ Boruto episode 168\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Boruto episode 41\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 339, pages 12-14\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 86\n\n↑ Boruto episode 169"}

In an attempt to retrieve the chakra bestowed upon her two sons, she imparted her will upon the God Tree and  — along with all the people tethered to it —  created what then became the Ten-Tails.[1] Titanic in size, she was able to use its power to fight her children for a length of months.\nImmediately prior to being sealed by Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya Ōtsutsuki formulated a plan that would result in her eventual revival. To accomplish this, she created a sentient being known as Black Zetsu, which would spend centuries fulfilling her desire.[2][3] Created as a malleable construct, Black Zetsu is capable of controlling the actions of others by coating itself over their bodies and taking possession of them.[4] Once the remnants of her chakra were finally reunited, Black Zetsu was able to revive her within a new host, Madara Uchiha. It was also capable of manipulating the husk of the Ten-Tails, extracting a number of White Zetsu from it.\n\nMadara Uchiha[]\nMadara Uchiha was also capable of using this ability. Moments prior to his death, he attempted to infuse his will into the right half of White Zetsu, seemingly creating Black Zetsu, which he referred to as a weaker version of himself; in actuality, Black Zetsu merely made it look like it was being created as part of its plan. \nMadara was actually able to impart his will into the black rod that emerged from the flowering tree he was attached to in his old age. Revealing it to Obito, Madara claimed that it was a physical manifestation of his will and that it should be used when performing the Six Paths Technique.[5]\nOn a later occasion, following his resurrection, Madara caused a number of these black rods to emerge from Obito's artificial right half, which became entirely coated in a black substance similar to Black Zetsu.[6] This allowed Madara to remotely control Obito's actions using his chakra, as well as fire black rods out of his body as projectiles, though Obito was ultimately able to resist his control.[7]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 681, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 678, pages 14-16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 681, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 656, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 606, pages 15-16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 636, pages 15-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 637"}

Using the Puppet Technique to manipulate them at will is what is known as the \"an amount matching one's fingers\" (指に数, Yubi ni sū) method. With this puppet collection it is literally possible to use one puppet with each finger — each boasting a power matching a thousand puppets put together. However, to use all of these secret mechanisms demands extremely high-class expertise and skill.\nThese ten puppets were created by the first puppeteer Monzaemon Chikamatsu and later came into Chiyo's possession, the use of which earned her great fame. These puppets are very powerful, as Sasori claimed that there were rumours that they had been used to take down an entire castle at one point in time.[2] The Chikamatsu Collection has terrifying prowess in taijutsu, ninjutsu, bukijutsu, and so on. Furthermore, as they can change their numbers by combining, the number of abilities they can show becomes even greater. The puppets were constructed in such a way that they all can work in tandem with each other both offensively and defensively.\n\n\nPuppets[]\nPuppet 1: This puppet somewhat resembled an \"oni\" (demon). Though it displayed no weaponry or hidden mechanisms, it had huge fists and immense striking power which Chiyo used to fend off attackers. It always kept closer to Chiyo in case it was needed as defence while she operated the other puppets.Puppet 2: This puppet had grey markings around its mouth area and hair coming from a single point on its head. It was shown to have colossal fists and fierce taijutsu skills. In the anime it was able to extend its arms to form a sort of cage to trap opponents, where it would then launch four small bombs from its mouth. Since the explosion was accurate and very small, it dealt a great amount of damage to enemies whilst not damaging the cage.Puppet 3: This puppet had a red face with white hair. It was used in conjunction with the black-haired puppet. It is able to lift a section of its face to reveal a spinning orb with four large chakra blades. Since these blades are made of chakra and spin rapidly, even a scrape can prove deadly. It is wielded like a weapon by its partner.Puppet 4: This puppet had long, black hair and works in conjunction with the red puppet. It is able to extend its hand via a chain, connecting with its partner's hand to hurl it around like a yo-yo, thus being able to slice through targets quickly and effectively. However, if one were to be destroyed, the other would become vulnerable.Puppet 5: A bald puppet with large holes in its skull. This puppet's hidden weapons are the long extending cables coiled in its skull that can pierce numerous enemies at a time. Since the range is very long, it can pierce distant targets without even getting close. Also, it is able to latch onto opponents with its cords and then crumble them slowly. It can also use taijutsu to fight, but lacks brute force.Puppet 6: This puppet had spiky hair and the lower half of its face was green in colour. It had the kanji for \"Sangha\" (僧, Sō) in its mouth, and worked in conjunction with the Buddha and Dharma puppets to use the Three Jewels Suction Crushing technique.Puppet 7: This puppet had a ponytail, a beard, red markings under its eyes and the kanji for \"Dharma\" (法, Hō) in its mouth, and worked with the Buddha and Sangha puppets to use the Three Jewels Suction Crushing technique.Puppet 8: This puppet had white hair and large sideburns with the kanji for \"Buddha\" (仏, Butsu) in its mouth which activated the Three Jewels Suction Crushing technique when used in conjunction with the Dharma and Sangha puppets.Puppet 9: This puppet was modelled after a female with red hair tied into buns. It wielded two large broad-swords and was capable of cleaving through enemies with ease, although the sheer size of the weapons reduced the puppet's dexterity somewhat. This puppet was one of the main attackers, and could fend off even the strongest of enemies at an alarming rate.Puppet 10: The final puppet had one eye, and was capable of releasing an orb from its mouth used for the Sealing Technique: Lion Closing Roar.\nTrivia[]\nChiyo forbade herself from using the Ten Puppets ever again, but reneged on that during her final battle against Sasori due to his power.\nSee Also[]\nRed Secret Technique: Performance of a Hundred Puppets\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 269\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 272, page 12"}

Once the stance is taken, the spirit of the Thousand-Armed Kannon is summoned to defend the user, or attack their enemies. The spirit is normally calm, angelic and looks peaceful. However, whenever the user gets angry, the spirit turns red and transforms into a demonic-looking creature. Kannon then attacks the user's target with its 1000 spirit fists. The size and power of the spirit is dependent upon the skill of the user.\n\nTrivia[]\nAlthough the spirit appearing with this technique is the bodhisattva Kannon, the Welcoming Approach refers to the appearance of the Amida Buddha at the time of one's death, welcoming the nearly-departed into the Pure Land. However, images of this Welcoming Approach often depict the Amida Buddha sitting on a purple cloud flanked by Kannon and Seishi, another bodhisattva.

{"jutsu_name":"Weather Manipulation","jutsu_type":"Hiden, Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"A special ability known by his clan, Yota can to freely manipulate the weather around him. Regardless of the natural atmosphere around him, he could manifest many different weather effects, effectively turning them into powerful attacks or defences. It should be noted that his area of effect is not limited to outside, as he is able to isolate his abilities to relatively closed off areas, while within them. Yota has shown to have a great level of control over the range and direction of his ability, and could use them simultaneously if need be.\nThe following effects have been shown:\n\nRain: Once manifested, it could rain softly or fiercely, and could even be directed towards a single person. The rain itself seems to have an unusual effects on his opponents, as it is able to drain them of their chakra and vitality, while seemingly making them sad as well. Once produced in terms of offence and defence, he could summon varying sizes of very powerful, pressurised, water trenches to either block incoming attacks, restrain, or crush his opponents. He could even create huge water bubbles that attacks opponents with concussive force. Coming from many different directions, each of his attacks could manifest from anywhere within his vicinity, seemingly coming from thin air.\nSnow: Showing only the offensive capabilities, Yota is able to turn a simple snowfall into a powerful blizzard, enabling him to near instantly freeze everything around him, including people.\nLightning: Yota can produce large bolts of purple lightning. The lightning could be directed from anywhere, to anywhere the enemy is, and in rapid succession. It was fast enough to keep up with Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru. Should the lightning ever connect, it is powerful enough to instantly kill the target. However, if Yota wills it, the lightning can completely obliterate the target, even if it is the latter himself.\nWind: Yota is able to fully manipulate the direction and intensity of wind by whistling. He could summon anything from a concentrated tornado, to several whirlwinds. Each of these attacks have the offensive capabilities to slash and wound the intended target. It was powerful enough to cut, and catch off guard, Naruto Uzumaki, despite being in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.\nSunlight: Yota could also make the sun shine brightly. Although it hasn't been used offensively or defensively, it has shown to cause flowers to bloom quickly around him."}

A user under water can focus chakra on their hands or any other body part that makes contact with the water's surface.

Because the water is clear, the wall doesn't obstruct the user's vision, allowing them to make their next move uninhibited.[1] The wall's initial formation, if timed correctly, can be used to fend off opponents, flinging them away as the wall rises.[3] In the anime, the water can also be gathered midair, and dispersed in all directions as a form of fire-fighting,[4] or shot from one's hand.[5]\nIn Sasuke Shinden, Sasuke Uchiha creates the Water Formation Wall around his allies rather than around himself, providing them a shield while he carries out other tasks.\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the manga, the hand seal sequence for this technique ends in the same seal that activates the Byakugan.\nIn the anime, when Tobirama uses this technique, a different and far more elaborate set of hand seals is used, involving a unique seal of the right hand cupping the left hand with a thumbs-up.\nIn some video games, such as Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, Tobirama uses this technique offensively, sending geysers of water outward in front of him.\nSee Also[]\nWater Release: Pillar Encirclement\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Tō no Sho, page 237\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 142\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 461, page 2\n\n↑ Boruto episode 234\n\n↑ Boruto episode 242"}

{"jutsu_name":"Water Prison Technique","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"This technique traps a target in a sphere of water; the water can either be drawn from the surroundings[2] or expelled from the user's mouth.[3] The water that the sphere is made from is noticeably heavy,[2] which restricts the target's movements and can make breathing difficult.[4] As such, those trapped within the water prison cannot ordinarily escape on their own. Neji Hyūga was able to free himself by simultaneously releasing chakra from all of his tenketsu, destroying the prison.[5] In Akatsuki Hiden, Kisame Hoshigaki escaped by increasing the volume of water within the prison beyond what it could contain, causing it to burst.\nIn order to maintain the prison, users must stay in contact with the sphere, typically by keeping an arm submerged within it. For this reason, water clones can be used in combination with water prisons, either by having the water clone attack other targets while the user maintains the prison,[6] or by having the clones themselves form the prisons, leaving the user free to act. In cases where a water clone forms the water prison, the water of the clone's body can be used as a source for the prison.[4] In the anime, this contact is shown to not be necessary, allowing users to trap targets from a distance,[7] and can draw in other people to trap upon contact with it.[8]\nThe water prison's usefulness has caused it to be adapted for other purposes. It can be stored in scrolls, trapping anyone who tries to read their contents without permission.[9] Alternatively, users can confine themselves within a water prison, thus preventing opponents from reaching them.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, Umibōzu's entire body is composed of water, which allows it to drown its opponents inside it, thus leading Amachi to refer to it as a \"Moving Water Prison Technique\" (動く水牢の術, Ugoku Suirō no Jutsu).[10]\nThe hands spread in front, palms out seal used for this is visually similar if not the same as the Zai (在) of the real Kuji-in also known as the \"seal of the ring of the sun\" which is shown as hands spread out in front with palms facing out, thumbs and index fingers touching.\nIn the anime, this technique is used by soldiers of the Funato Clan.[11]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Rin no Sho, page 202\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 13, page 7\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 508, page 3\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 257, pages 16-18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 258, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 13, page 10\n\n↑ Boruto episode 28\n\n↑ Boruto episode 234\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 508, pages 15-16\n\n↑ Naruto episode 172\n\n↑ Boruto episode 245"}

With enough chakra added to it, the Rasengan can become giant.\nIn the anime, Kakashi Hatake notes that the invisible nature comes by a loss in offensive power, rendering this technique as incomplete.[4] Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki himself later noted that it is too weak to cause a mortal wound, but is quite painful when it strikes a vital point.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the Boruto: Naruto the Movie novelisation, this technique was stated to use a subconscious application of Wind Release instead of Lightning Release.\nIn the anime, Naruto was able to throw a standard Rasengan, similar to the main function of this technique.[6]\nIn various media, when Boruto uses this technique, he simply calls it \"Rasengan\".\n     An orange-coloured Vanishing Rasengan.  \nIn Boruto OVA, this technique was depicted as orange in colour, similarly to how the original Rasengan is sometimes depicted being yellow in the manga when used by Naruto, and orange on one Jump cover.[7][8]\nSee Also[]\nRunt Ball Rasengan\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 14\n\n↑ Naruto x Boruto: Ninja Tribes\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto the Movie novel\n\n↑ Boruto episode 168\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 54, page 26\n\n↑ Naruto episode 194\n\n↑ Boruto OVA\n\n↑ Weekly Shōnen Jump 2005, Issue #35"}

{"jutsu_name":"Truth-Seeking Ball","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Senjutsu","jutsu_description":"Truth-Seeking Balls are orbs of malleable black chakra, which can alter their form and characteristics in various ways. Though only the size of a fist, each hides within it the power to obliterate an entire forest.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Acquisition\n2 Usage\n\n2.1 Shape Transformation\n\n\n3 Tenseigan Influence\n4 Trivia\n5 See Also\n6 References\n\n\nAcquisition[]\nThose who awaken Six Paths Senjutsu are able to wield Truth-Seeking Balls.[1] Hagoromo and Hamura Ōtsutsuki appear to have possessed this power naturally,[3] whereas others may obtain it by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, or by receiving it directly from Hagoromo. Entering Tenseigan Chakra Mode also grants the user Truth-Seeking Balls.[4]\nThe number of Truth-Seeking Balls acquired varies from user to user. Acquisition method may determine the number, as both Obito Uchiha and Madara Uchiha gained ten orbs upon becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki; Obito initially only formed two,[5] obtaining the other eight upon gaining control of the Ten-Tails' power.[6] Upon receiving power from Hagoromo, Naruto Uzumaki, instead gained nine orbs,[7] while Asura Ōtsutsuki only showed five orbs,[8] nine orbs in the anime.[9] Toneri Ōtsutsuki is depicted with an inconsistent amount.[4] Due to having previously been the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki,[10] Obito was able to manifest a single Truth-Seeking Ball after  absorbing some of Madara's power.[11]\n\nUsage[]\nWhen not in use, Truth-Seeking Balls generally float behind the user's back in a circular formation, though two of Obito's float behind his hands,[12] Hagoromo's float beneath him while levitating,[13] and Hamura's instead form a sigmoidal formation.[4] The orbs are always on standby once created,[14] and users cannot create additional orbs after the initial acquisition number; thus, orbs that are lost for whatever reason cannot be replaced. In Naruto's case, the orbs currently under his control disappear and reappear alongside his chakra cloak,[15] while the orbs he has discarded remain active.[16] Clones are not created with orbs of their own,[17] though the user can temporarily transfer them to a clone.[18]\nTruth-Seeking Balls encompass the power of all five basic natures,[19] and as such they surpass both kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta.[5] By combining the various natures inside the orbs, it is possible to produce a variety of effects.[1] They are capable of instantly turning anything they touch to dust in a manner similar to Dust Release,[5] though this does not always occur.[20] If imbued with a certain Yin–Yang Release jutsu, the orbs can nullify any ninjutsu they touch and thus become impervious to it; this includes negating the regenerative qualities of Impure World Reincarnation, making it possible to permanently damage and kill those reincarnated by the technique.[21] However, the orbs are incapable of nullifying senjutsu,[22] as according to Naruto, natural energy can be used to combat itself.[23]\nNaruto can use Truth-Seeking Balls to create his Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken.[24] Similarly, Obito was able to convert one of his orbs into black receivers, allowing him to use the Six Red Yang Formation.[25][26] While in their default sphere form, the orbs can be launched as high-speed projectiles,[27] expanded to enormous sizes in an instant.[28] Whatever their shape, users can only control the orbs within 70 metres of their location, allowing opponents to disable them by transporting them elsewhere.[14] If the user is killed or similarly incapacitated, their Truth-Seeking Balls will disintegrate alongside any black receivers they created.[29]\n\nShape Transformation[]\nTruth-Seeking Balls can be controlled individually or combined together; in both cases, by understanding the power of \"all things in nature\" (森羅万象, Shinra Banshō), the orbs can be shaped into a variety of forms. Because the high-density chakra is in a condensed state, it can be pulled and stretched into a smooth and flat consistency, as well as freely manipulated into any other shape.[1] Hiruzen Sarutobi theorised that there is a limit to how long the orbs can maintain a certain shape,[5] though this was never confirmed. Most users are able to reshape their Truth-Seeking Balls without any special effort,[30] though Obito does so by passing them through holes that temporarily form in his hands.[5] The orbs can also wrap around the user's body to form a protective shell.[31] Though highly durable, this defence can still be broken by attacks that cannot be nullified, such as powerful senjutsu and taijutsu.[32][33]\n\nStretched around the user as a defence.A weapon with adjustable length and thickness, called a \"Truth-Seeking Umbrella\" (求道傘, Gudōkasa) in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing.The Sword of Nunoboko (left hand) and a shield (right hand).Converted into black receivers.Used similar to chakra arms.Reshaped to serve as a platform.Obito's shakujō.Madara's shakujō.Naruto's \"Six Paths Bō\" (六道の棒, Rikudō no Bō).[34]\nTenseigan Influence[]\n     Toneri's Truth-Seeking Ball infused with Tenseigan chakra.  \nWhile in Tenseigan Chakra Mode, Toneri could enhance his Truth-Seeking Balls by infusing them with glowing green chakra. Rather than simple black constructs, Toneri demonstrated the ability to transform one of these glowing orbs into an ornate golden cage. He could also combine them to create a massive vortex capable of blasting through the moon's surface and a giant sword capable of cutting the entire moon in half.[4]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe term Truth-Seeker (求道, Kyūdō; Gudō) comes from Mahāyāna Buddhism. The kanji 求 means to wish for, while the Way (道, Dō) in Mahāyāna doctrine is to find the ultimate truth within one's own mind.\nIf the Truth-Seeking Balls contain natural energy, users should not be able to add ninjutsu-negating Yin–Yang Release to them, as natural energy is precisely what causes other jutsu to become immune to erasure.\nAlthough they can nullify ninjutsu, the orbs can still be teleported away partly or wholly by Space–Time Ninjutsu.[35]\nDespite stating that the orbs are wielded by Six Paths Senjutsu users, the fourth databook does not classify this technique as senjutsu.[1]\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and Jump Force, Truth-Seeking Balls give off a purple glow. In the former, Obito employs the orbs in several unique ways, such as forming scythes, drills, spinning disks, hands capable of firing Tailed Beast Balls and blasts of chakra.\nDespite repeatedly accessing his orbs every time he entered Six Paths Sage Mode during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto has not been seen accessing them since whenever using said form.\nIn Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu, Obito has a technique called \"Truth-Seeking Ball: Trailokya Extinction\" (求道玉・三界死滅, Gudōdama: Sangai Shimetsu), in which he combines his Truth-Seeking Balls into a single expanding orb that obliterates the surrounding area. The technique refers to the Trailokya, the three realms of karmic rebirth in Buddhist cosmology.\nSee Also[]\nRed Orbs\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 Fourth Databook, page 249\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 669, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 690, page 4\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 The Last: Naruto the Movie\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 Naruto chapter 639, pages 6-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 640, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 670, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 468\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 666, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 665, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 643, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 670, page 2\n\n↑ 14.0 14.1 Naruto chapter 669, pages 6-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 695, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 660, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 675, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 686, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 689, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 672, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 642, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 642, pages 14-16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 643, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 676, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 643, pages 9-11\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 255\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 666, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 640, pages 5-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 680, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 673, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 641, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 651, pages 12-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 669, pages 15-16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 675, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 669, pages 14-15"}

Later, when Guren is in danger of being harmed by the Three-Tailed Beast, he is able to halt it completely without Kabuto's pills.

Not only does this allow foresight, it also shows multiple possible futures.\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n\n1.1 Foreseen Futures\n\n\n2 Trivia\n3 Influence\n4 See also\n\n\nUsage[]\nAmado Sanzu had integrated Shibai's cells into the Inners of Kara, along with Ada and Daemon, with the intention of them using his shinjutsu. While the siblings were able to use his shinjutsu, none of the Inners (except for Code) have shown any signs of awakening his abilities. \nAt the brink of death during his battle with Isshiki Ōtsutsuki, Koji Kashin had awakened Ten Directions, allowing the former Inner to foresee future events. Having seen Omnipotence being cast before it had happened, Koji used this vision to deduce the phenomenon had altered his memories of Boruto Uzumaki and Kawaki, which he managed to figure out that Boruto has always been the real son of the Seventh Hokage when he was born. Three years later, Koji would become partners with Boruto and using the Ten Directions, the future knowledge he gained from the shinjutsu had helped Boruto accelerate and improve his training. By teaching him all the skills and techniques he would learn in different potential futures.\n\nForeseen Futures[]\nBecause the future is not a straight path, Ten Directions gives the user many alternate possibilities of what could be the future. The following are the visions that Koji had foreseen:\n\nIn his fight with Isshiki, Naruto died. Isshiki would then successfully reincarnate through Kawaki's Kāma and use Boruto as the sacrifice for the Ten-Tails to plant the God Tree. This future was avoided.\nAfter sealing Naruto and Hinata away with Daikokuten, Kawaki successfully killed Boruto and Sarada, when she tried to defend him. Omnipotence is not cast by Ada, resulting in Boruto and Kawaki's lives never being swapped in everyone's memories. This would lead to Kawaki being defeated by Code and used as the sacrifice for the Ten-Tails. This future was avoided.\nIn nearly all outcomes, the Ten-Tails breaks free of Code's control and evolves into multiple sentient God Trees.\nIn most outcomes, Boruto is killed by Jura and Kawaki is devoured by the Ten-Tails. The God Tree is grown, resulting in the end of the world.\nSix years after Boruto's defection from Konoha, he creates his own variation of the Flying Thunder God Technique. This was accomplished five years early thanks to Koji's knowledge of the future.\nTrivia[]\nKoji believes that the more people are foretold of a specific future, the more the nature of said future would change, as the people would be unable to act the same way as they did not know. Instead, it would lead to new potential futures to be branched complexly and unpredictably, to the point of nullifying the advantages of the foresight.\nInfluence[]\nIn Buddhism, the expression \"Ten Directions\" refers to a concept of comprehensiveness and totality that is often used to describe the entirety of the universe and the reach of the Dharma, the Buddhist teachings. The \"Ten Directions\" include the eight cardinal points—north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest—along with up and down, representing the totality of space. This concept is used to illustrate the idea that the Dharma is universal and encompasses all areas of existence and experience.

Despite the fact that Naruto was in his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, he still sustained injuries on his hand when practising the technique. Naruto asks Killer B to watch and tell him when he has got the ratio right so he can remember the feel of the technique. Naruto has also noted that this new Rasengan is quite heavy, as he can barely hold it up. This is likely because of the Nine-Tails' chakra, which has been described as very dense in previous instances.[1][2] According to Killer B, he has almost perfected it, and the best way to learn and master it was from real-life experience on the battlefield.[3] Later, during the Fourth Shinobi World War, after gaining Kurama's cooperation, Naruto gained the ability to use the Tailed Beast Ball, and subsequently, developed the Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball, leaving the completion of this technique unnecessary.[4]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe positive and negative chakra are coloured differently in the anime, with red for negative and blue for positive.[5]\nIn the anime-exclusive Power arc, Naruto managed to create an incomplete yet effective Tailed Beast Rasengan (before he had absolute control of the Nine-Tails' chakra) which was able to petrify his Nine-Tailed clone.[6]\nSee Also[]\nSuper Mini-Tailed Beast Ball\nTailed Beast Ball\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 295, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 504, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 529, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 595, pages 4-6\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 264\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 295"}

{"jutsu_name":"Tailed Beast Chakra Arms","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"This is an ability a jinchūriki is able to perform when in a tailed form. The jinchūriki will use the raw chakra of their Tailed Beast to form arms, which they can freely manipulate to attack their foes, able to strike an opponent faster than even a Sharingan user can react to.[2] The chakra arms' hands are clawed while the rest of the arm seems to lack any kind of joint, thus allowing them to have flexible movements that will generally be impossible for normal arms. The user can create any number of arms that they desire and they can also serve other purposes such as grappling hooks, to either grab onto objects or enemies from great distances, for offensive means, as merely touching one of these can cause fatal burns, due to the Nine-Tails' seething hatred within its chakra (though this is not always the case). Due to having chakra attached to his body, the chakra arms can grow in size and from the fourth tail up, Naruto, the arms, or any part of his body can divide into two or more fully operational appendages.[3] Killer B has also been shown to use this technique though instead of arms, he can form horns which he uses for his Lightning Release: Lariat technique.[4]\nIn his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto can use the chakra arms to a greater extent, as he can use and release chakra arms from anywhere on his body on a small or large scale. These arms even have the power to crush stone without Naruto putting much thought into it.[5] In the anime Naruto was able to crush a sword with a chakra arm just by tightening his grip.[6] After some practice, he mastered the chakra arms, able to manipulate various stones and geometric shapes without crushing them.[7] Now he is able to use them in an attempt to create a new technique: the Tailed Beast Rasengan since he was advised by the Eight-Tails against the use of shadow clones in this form.[8] Naruto's mastery of the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms is so great that he is able to create several at once to launch attacks at several enemies, use them to pull enemies into the attack, and even create tiny ones around his finger. The arms also grant him a greater level of dexterity and manoeuvrability out of what would normally be a helpless situation,[9] such as guiding his Rasenshuriken during his fight against the Third Raikage. Not only that, Naruto can control each individual shroud he gives out to protect his allies.\n\nTrivia[]\nGaara never used a tailed beast chakra shroud form like Naruto and Killer B. He instead uses his sand control to shape existing sand into arms. He has shown similar techniques when he does slip into his Shukaku forms.\nIn Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze, Magire and Kido Tsumiki created a Tailed Beast Drug that allowed them to use the Tailed Beast Chakra Arms.\nIn Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Card Battle, Naruto's powerful blows in Jinchūriki Form are known as \"Simple Strike\" (無造作な一撃, Muzōsana Ichigeki).\nSee Also[]\nHands of Bonds\nHands of Flame\nMonstrous Sand Arm\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto Trading Card Game\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 231, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 294, pages 5-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 413, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 515, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 317\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 516, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 519, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 549, pages 10-11"}

{"jutsu_name":"Tailed Beast Ball","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the technique. For the chapter, see The Tailed Beast Ball.\n\n\n\n\nThe Tailed Beast Ball is the ultimate technique of a tailed beast, which can also be used by a jinchūriki while transformed.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Firing Methods\n3 Video Games Variations\n4 Trivia\n5 See Also\n6 References\n\n\nOverview[]\n     The gathering of positive and negative chakra.  \nTailed Beast Balls are made from an 8:2 ratio of positive black chakra (+の黒チャクラ, purasu no kuro chakura) and negative white chakra (−の白チャクラ, mainasu no shiro chakura).[2] Users must gather and balance this chakra in their mouths, shape it into a sphere (or a conical shape in the case of the Ten-Tails), and then fire it at their target; Gyūki likens this to vomiting.[3] Most users fire their Tailed Beast Balls as-is, while others may consume the ball and fire it from their mouth as a beam, focusing the attack on a narrower area instead of letting it detonate all around upon impact. Gyūki is even shown doing something in between, not consuming its Tailed Beast Ball yet still firing it out in a wave.[4] There is no limit to how much chakra can be put into a Tailed Beast Ball so long as the 8:2 ratio is maintained: Kurama has shown to be able to create a Tailed Beast Ball many times bigger than itself when using even a fraction of its chakra. [5] Tailed Beasts can also combine their Tailed Beast Balls to form it into a very large one.[6]\nTailed Beast Balls are incredibly dense, so much so that despite being suspended in the air, they instantly crater the ground beneath the user due to their extreme weight.[7][8]  Despite how heavy they are, they move at an incredible rate once fired. When used by the Ten-Tails, the Tailed Beast Ball was able to cross several miles in only a few seconds.[9] Tailed Beast Balls are very destructive, creating explosions that are visible from incredibly far away and that vaporize almost everything in the blast area.[10] The extent of the damage is dependent upon how the ball is fired and how much chakra it has. Its \"standard\" size is enough to easily vaporize mountains.[11] The power of the Tailed Beast Ball is shown to even dwarf islands, however, Kurama and Gyūki have been shown to cause immense damage, such that the devastation dwarfed entire mountain ranges and could be felt across the continent. Tailed Beast Balls are comparatively weaker if a jinchūriki uses one without entering their Tailed Beast Mode, yet it is still potent enough to represent a serious threat to people and infrastructure.[12]\nSome jinchūriki are shown using Tailed Beast Balls in atypical ways. As the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, Obito Uchiha is able to form multiple Tailed Beast Balls at once via a tree he creates, each of which can fire in a different direction.[13] Naruto, when using his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, can form a Tailed Beast Ball with his hands, similar to how he makes the Rasengan.[14] He can also add natural energy to his Tailed Beast Balls, increasing their power and potency,[15] while also allowing them to be used against Truth-Seeking Balls.[16] In the anime, Sora uses an entirely white Tailed Beast Ball while transformed under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra.[17] Himawari Uzumaki is able to form a Tailed Beast Ball incredibly quickly from her mouth and hair which act like tails, making her resemble a miniature Kurama in her usage.[18]\nBeing incarnations of the Ten-Tails, the sentient God Trees have been shown to have the capability of using the Tailed Beast Ball. Unlike the tailed beasts and jinchūriki, Jura formed a Tailed Beast Ball from his right Rinnegan.[19]\n\nFiring Methods[]\nFired as a ball.Fired as a beam.Fired as a wave.Fired from an eye.Fired from hair.\nVideo Games Variations[]\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Gaara is able to form Shukaku's head out of sand and through it create a Tailed Beast Ball.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Gyūki performs a Lightning Release version of this technique.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, Saiken performs a variation of this technique utilising Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Naruto and Sasuke perform a variation of this technique wherein the Tailed Beast Ball is coated with Sasuke's Amaterasu and the Tailed Beasts' specific chakra types are added to the ball. This was used against Madara Uchiha's gigantic Chibaku Tensei.\nTrivia[]\nMinato Namikaze based the Rasengan off of the Tailed Beast Ball. Killer B observes that the process for forming a Rasengan is exactly the same as forming a Tailed Beast Ball, with its chakra rotation acting as a substitute for the tailed beast form.[2]\nIn the manga, the Tailed Beast Ball is formed from positive black chakra and negative white chakra, and the completed ball is black.[20] In the anime, it is formed from positive blue chakra and negative red chakra, and the completed ball is purple.[21] In some instances, it is depicted taking on a red colour upon being fired.[22]\nIn J-Stars Victory VS, Naruto's Tailed Beast Ball uses the manga's colour scheme, but glows yellow upon being fired.\nShukaku is the only tailed beast not seen using a Tailed Beast Ball in the manga. However, it does so in an anime-only dream world created by the Infinite Tsukuyomi.[23]\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Orochimaru is capable of using a similar attack when using his Eight Branches Technique.\nIn the anime, one of the Infinite Tsukuyomi's dream worlds depicts the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path using this technique.[23]\nIn Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze, Kido Tsumiki has access to the Tailed Beast Ball via the usage of his Tailed Beast Drug. However, while powerful, his Tailed Beast Ball is noted to be nowhere near as powerful as ones coming from a true Tailed Beast.[citation needed]\nSee Also[]\nGiant Sphere\nTailed Beast Rasengan\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, pages 282-283\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 519, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 519, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 414, pages 6-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 499, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 571, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 295, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto, chapter 571, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 613, pages 11-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 613, pages 8-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 571, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 438, pages 7-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 643, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 598, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 695, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 645, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 71\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 11, pages 14-15\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 9, page 32\n\n↑ Volume 55 cover\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 264\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 329\n\n↑ 23.0 23.1 Naruto: Shippūden episode 430"}

{"jutsu_name":"Susanoo","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the technique. For the chapter, see Susanoo…!!.\n\n\n\nSusanoo is a gigantic, humanoid avatar made of the user's chakra which surrounds them and fights on their behalf, that has been handed down throughout all the generations of the Uchiha Clan.[2] It is the strongest ability available to those who have awakened the Mangekyō Sharingan in both eyes.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Attributes\n2 Development\n3 Versions\n\n3.1 Itachi Uchiha\n3.2 Sasuke Uchiha\n3.3 Madara Uchiha\n3.4 Indra Ōtsutsuki\n3.5 Shisui Uchiha\n3.6 Kakashi Hatake\n3.7 Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki\n3.8 Merz\n\n\n4 Influence\n5 Trivia\n6 See Also\n7 References\n\n\nAttributes[]\nWhen activated, Susanoo forms around the user and becomes an extension of their will, acting and attacking on their behalf. By default, Susanoo is anchored to its user and they to it: in its less developed forms it will move around with the user; in its more completed forms the user will be suspended within Susanoo, being brought with it as it moves around.[4] This connection allows Susanoo to be a shield against physical attacks, one that becomes more difficult to penetrate as it is manifested more fully.\nAlthough Susanoo is quite effective as a defence, it is able to distinguish in what it blocks. For example, the user can still perform jutsu while within Susanoo, such attacks being able to pass through it to the outside without complications.[5] Others can be brought within Susanoo with the user's permission,[6] and users can likewise choose to leave Susanoo's protective structure.[7] The latter characteristic can be used against the user; if an opponent can bypass Susanoo, however slightly, and latch onto them, they may be forcibly pulled out of Susanoo.[8] With continued mastery, Susanoo can have increased defensive capabilities even at its ribcage stage, as seen when A was able to crack a rib of Sasuke's Susanoo, but conversely, could not crack Madara's. If it is damaged, Susanoo does not regenerate and it can only be repaired either by advancing it to the next developmental stage or by dispersing it and then forming it anew. Also, Susanoo is also only able to defend against physical attacks, so they are still vulnerable to visual[9] or auditory attacks for example.[10] Additionally, unless the legs of the Susanoo are fully manifested, the user's still vulnerable to attacks from below.[11]\nSusanoo draws on the user's chakra in large amounts so long as it is active. Sasuke Uchiha describes the sensation of using Susanoo as feeling pain in every cell in his body, which only increases over time of usage as well as at higher developmental stages.[12] Being a Mangekyō Sharingan-based ability, it also places a strain on the user's eyes the more it is used, however, it is not actually necessary for one's Mangekyō Sharingan to be active while using Susanoo;[13] in fact, Madara Uchiha is able to use it without any eyes at all.[14]\n\nDevelopment[]\n     Madara's Susanoo ribcage.  \nAs seen with Sasuke's learning how to use it, Susanoo has several developmental stages. Practised users go through all the stages every time they manifest it, layering more advanced stages over earlier ones or stripping them away as is needed; they can choose to stop at any developmental stage. At its simplest level, users only manifest aspects of Susanoo's skeletal structure, such as a ribcage for basic defence[15] or an arm for interacting with the surroundings.[16] Once a full skeleton is made, musculature and, later, skin forms until finally a complete humanoid is shaped. In these early stages, typically only the upper half of Susanoo is materialised, with legs becoming common once it reaches its full humanoid form; however, not all Susanoo users can accomplish the latter feat.\nIn its next stage, armour forms around the humanoid for further protection, causing it to resemble a yamabushi. In its final stage, users stabilise the chakra that comprises Susanoo to create a colossal form known as the Complete Body — Susanoo (完成体　須佐能乎, Kanseitai — Susanoo, Viz: Perfect Susanoo, literally meaning: Complete Body — He with the ability to help by all means), the ultimate ability of the Mangekyō Sharingan.[17] In this state, Susanoo gains a tengu-like nose, wings for flight, and is clad with robes and ornate armour. This form is generally the size of a tailed beast, with the exception of Hagoromo's, which was roughly the size of the Ten-Tails. This form also possesses power comparable to that of a tailed beast, capable of levelling giant mountains and, when enhanced by Six Paths Chakra, small planetoids with ease. Users can also channel their own techniques into the Complete Body — Susanoo,[18] as well as shape it around the Nine-Tails to improve its offensive and defensive capabilities.\n\n     Sasuke's Senjutsu Susanoo.  \nUsers are able to mingle the chakra that makes Susanoo with chakra from other sources. Sasuke uses the chakra from Jūgo's Sage Transformation to make a \"Senjutsu Susanoo\" (仙術須佐能乎, literally meaning: Sage Technique He with the ability to help by all means), with markings reminiscent of the Cursed Seal of Heaven spreading across it.[19] He later stores the chakra of the nine tailed beasts within his Susanoo, drastically improving its strength and causing lightning to emanate from its back.[20]\n\nVersions[]\nSusanoo differs between users, in terms of colour, design, and weaponry. Some features are consistent, however, all Susanoo constructs are deviations of the Japanese tengu, and have two sets of arms — one of which can form wings as part of its Complete Body form — and six fingers on each of its hands. All Susanoo wield at least one sword.\n\nItachi Uchiha[]\nItachi Uchiha's Susanoo was yellow in the manga;[21] in the anime, its skeletal and armoured forms were red and its humanoid form was orange.[22] In its humanoid form, its face was framed by locks of hair, with an appendage on its chin reminiscent of a Pharaoh's false beard. When its armour was formed, Itachi's Susanoo resembled a long-nosed tengu and it wore a pair of magatama earrings.\nItachi's Susanoo possessed a curved blade that resembled a dagger or tantō.[23] He rarely used this, preferring his Sword of Totsuka, wielded in its primary right hand and sheathed in a sake jar held by its second right hand. The Sword of Totsuka is an ethereal weapon with an enchanted blade that, in addition to standard cutting, can seal anyone it pierces, trapping them in a genjutsu-like \"world of drunken dreams\" for all eternity. In its primary left hand, Itachi's Susanoo wielded the Yata Mirror, a shield that can change its nature depending on the attack it receives, thus nullifying it. According to Black Zetsu, the simultaneous use of the Sword of Totsuka and the Yata Mirror made Itachi essentially invincible.[1] For long-range attacks, Itachi could use Susanoo to perform Yasaka Magatama.[24] In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Itachi has an exclusive Complete Body — Susanoo form that retains the traits of his previous forms, including a retractable version of the Yata Mirror, and a broadsword version of the Sword of Totsuka.\n\nItachi's skeletal Susanoo.Itachi's humanoid Susanoo.Itachi's armoured Susanoo.Itachi's Complete Body — Susanoo, game only.\nSasuke Uchiha[]\nSasuke Uchiha's Susanoo was initially depicted as a dark shade of blue in the manga,[25] though it is purple in all other medias. Because Sasuke's development has often been marked by intense feelings of hatred, his Susanoo is noted to be much darker in composition compared to Itachi's.[26] Whereas Itachi's Susanoo appears relatively \"normal\", Sasuke's possesses demonic horns, a long appendage on its chin, and a malevolent grin. Its armoured form initially appears largely the same as Itachi's save for having jagged teeth around its hood.[27] After Sasuke gains the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan, however, its appearance changes, the armour's mouth taking on a beak-like shape and generally becoming ghastly-looking.[28]In its Complete Body form, Sasuke's Susanoo has a helmet that features a long tengu nose, two spikes over each eye, a slit stretching across its mouth, three gaps on each of its cheeks and one additional gap on its chin. Like Madara's, it is massive, comparable in size to Kurama after Naruto Uzumaki got Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's chakra.\nBecause of his Rinnegan, Sasuke can use the wings of his Complete Body Susanoo to block out the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi[29] (and in Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections the Engraved Tsukuyomi). When drawing on the power of the tailed beasts, the armour of his so-called \"Indra Susanoo\" (インドラ須佐能乎, Indora Susanoo)[30] is reduced somewhat, exposing the humanoid within.[31] This form is capable of generating a sword instead of having it form alongside the Complete Body — Susanoo, enabling him to catch opponents off guard.[32] It can be used as a projectile and can explode into massive pillars on lightning large enough to engulf Kurama.[33]\nSasuke's Susanoo has a blade in all its forms: a sabre in its developmental forms,[34] an ōdachi in its humanoid form, wielded with its second right hand,[35] and finally a pair of katana in its Complete Body form.[36] Its primary weapon, though, is a bow, manifested on the wrist of its left arm; the bow can double as a shield, a function that becomes more visually apparent in its armoured form.[27] Arrows are drawn from an orb held by its primary right hand and can be fired very quickly, such that only Kabuto Yakushi, while utilising Sage Mode, has been able to avoid one.[37] Weapon properties can be augmented, either with black flames in its armoured form[38] or lightning in its Complete Body state.[39] Sasuke is able to perform techniques through his Susanoo, such as Chidori[40] and Great Fireball Technique.\n\nSasuke's skeletal Susanoo.Sasuke's humanoid Susanoo.Sasuke's armoured Susanoo.Sasuke's armoured Susanoo (Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan version).Sasuke's Complete Body — Susanoo.Sasuke's Indra Susanoo.\nMadara Uchiha[]\nMadara Uchiha's Susanoo was dark blue in colour.[41] His Susanoo was made up of two entirely different sides that were conjoined along their spine, both of which had a distinct face: the front face had elongated canine teeth in its lower jaw bracket and two tusks growing from said jaw, while the back face had similarly elongated canine teeth in its upper jaw bracket and a single horn protruding from its forehead. In its armoured form, the usual tengu-like armour splits from its forehead down, revealing Susanoo's eyes while obscuring the rest of its face. Curiously, his armoured Susanoo appeared to always form the Tiger hand seal with its front hands, and was the largest of its variation.[42][43] In its Complete Body form, its head gained a long tengu nose and two lines running down from its mouth to its chin area, as well as hair which was tied up at the sides, and dwarfs a mountain-sized meteor that he had brought down on the Fourth Division during the war show it was at least several hundred meters tall.\nMadara's Susanoo wielded distinct, undulating blades that resembled kris, held in the right hand of each side. He was able to throw the blades as guided projectiles.[44] In the anime, Madara was able to manifest swords in all four of Susanoo's arms; the blades left traces of blue, fire-like chakra in the ground after impacting and could unleash shockwaves capable of obliterating numerous shinobi in a single strike.[45] In its Complete Body form, the swords more closely resembled traditional katana or tachi, complete with sheaths held in the secondary arms. One of the swords could cut cleanly bisect several mountains with a single stroke and from far away.[46] For long-range attacks, Madara could use Susanoo to perform Yasaka Magatama.[47]\n\nMadara's skeletal Susanoo.Madara's humanoid Susanoo.Madara's armoured Susanoo.Madara's Complete Body — Susanoo.\nIndra Ōtsutsuki[]\nIndra Ōtsutsuki's Susanoo, named Origin: Susanoo (根源・須佐能乎, Kongen: Susanoo), was purple in colour. In its Complete Body form, it had accentuated eye-holes, a long tengu nose, a spike over each eye, a slit across its mouth and three gaps on each of its cheeks.[48] In the anime, the skeletal form of Indra's Susanoo was also shown.[49]\n\nIndra's skeletal Susanoo.Indra's Complete Body — Susanoo.\n\nShisui Uchiha[]\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution, Shisui Uchiha can use a green Susanoo. It has blade-like appendages on its shoulders, the side of its face, and along its forearms. Its right arm wields a drill-like lance that Shisui can coat with fire to create a vortex of flames. It is also able to unleash a barrage of chakra needles. In Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Shisui has an exclusive Complete Body — Susanoo form, complete with a second pair of wing-shaped arms, tengu like features, and wielding a large drill-like sword. \n\nShisui's humanoid Susanoo.Shisui's Complete Body — Susanoo, game only.\n\nKakashi Hatake[]\nKakashi Hatake's Susanoo is light blue in colour. The Susanoo he uses has only been seen in a Complete Body form. It had the characteristic tengu nose, a forehead protector-like plating on its head, two locks of hair falling on either side of its face, a hole in its chin, and a vertical mark extending across its left eye, similar to Kakashi's own signature scar. It wields a katana,[50] but its most notable weaponry are the Mangekyō-shaped shuriken that can warp away targets on contact.[51]\n\nKakashi's Complete Body — Susanoo.\n\nHagoromo Ōtsutsuki[]\nIn the anime, Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki showed a light blue Susanoo capable of entering its Complete Body form and utilising chakra blades. Two locks of hair fell on each side of the face and a single horn protruded from the chin, resembling Hagoromo's facial hair. It possessed a sharp tengu-like nose and a jagged mouth, giving it a demonic appearance. His Susanoo was much larger than other users, reaching a size comparable to the Ten-Tails.[52]\n\nHagoromo's Complete Body — Susanoo.\n\nMerz[]\nIn Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections, Merz had attained the Mangekyō Sharingan state in both his artificial Sharingan. This allowed him to use Susanoo, surprising Sasuke Uchiha. His Susanoo had some minor visual differences from that of other Susanoo users, as it was more skeletal in appearance, and its back and arms were covered in black flames resembling those of Amaterasu, while its blade was coated in red flames. Having trained to master the eyes, Merz's Susanoo was a Complete Body — Susanoo. By tapping into Nanashi's chakra acquired through Yachihoko, it took a gargantuan size, dwarfing even Sasuke's Susanoo and Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode. With his Susanoo, Merz could use Yasaka Magatama, and fend off a weakened Majestic Attire: Susanoo from Naruto and Sasuke. He could also use Susanoo: Blade of Yachihoko to absorb the chakra from all those affected by the Engraved Tsukuyomi in order to increase the size of his sword, and repair any damage to his Susanoo unlike other users, though doing so took some time.\n\nInfluence[]\nSimilar to other Mangekyō Sharingan abilities, Susanoo was taken from Japanese mythology: Susanoo is the wild god of sea and storms, brother to Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi. He was born from Izanagi washing his nose. Susanoo inherited his father's sword Totsuka no Tsurugi, which Izanagi used to kill his newborn son, Kagu-Tsuchi after his birth burned his mother, Izanami, to death. After his exile for his relentless harassment of Amaterasu, Susanoo redeemed himself when he used Totsuka to slay the serpent Yamata no Orochi and obtained the Sword of Kusanagi from the monster's corpse. He later gave the acquired blade to Amaterasu as a peace offering.\nSusanoo's designs are based on Tengu (天狗), well known yokai that are associated with the ascetic practice of shugendō. In their final forms, the Susanoo are garbed in the attire of shugendō practioners, known as yamabushi, and wear hoods that resemble tengu masks, with Itachi's and Madara's appearing as long-nosed Hanataka Tengu and Sasuke's as a crow-billed Karasu Tengu. In Japanese myth, Susanoo produced the fiend Amanozako who is said to have been the progenitor of the Tengu.\nMadara's Susanoo design may be influenced by Ryomen Sukuna (両面宿儺), a human-like being described in the Nihon Shoki (日本書紀) as having one body with two faces back-to-back, each with its own set of arms and legs.\nThe Yata no Kagami (八咫鏡, literally meaning: Eight Span Mirror) is one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan (三種の神器, Sanshu no Jingi), together with the Sword of Kusanagi and the Yasakani no Magatama (八尺瓊曲玉, literally meaning: Eight Shaku Curved Jewel).\nItachi's Susanoo carries the Sword of Totsuka in a gourd. An ethereal weapon inside a gourd could be a reference to the hyōtan-kozō, a gourd spirit from Japanese folklore.\nSusanoo's skeletal stages also resemble the Gashadokuro (餓者髑髏, literally meaning: Starving Skeleton), a yokai composed of the vengeful souls of fallen soldiers who were not properly buried, taking the form of a skeleton fifteen times the size of a regular person.\nTrivia[]\n     Sasuke's armoured Susanoo in the anime.  \nIn the anime, Sasuke's armoured Susanoo is depicted as being identical to Itachi's, even wielding weapons identical to the Sword of Totsuka and Yata Mirror.[53] Its appearance and weapons were changed to match the manga in subsequent appearances.\nAlthough the third databook states that the user must first unlock Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu before they can gain Susanoo,[1] it appears that this was only the case for Itachi. According to the fourth databook, acquiring this technique is done through the user simply manifesting the Mangekyō Sharingan in both eyes.[17]\nPrior to the completion of Sasuke's Susanoo, its humanoid form was glimpsed as a shadowy figure in a genjutsu he used.[54]\nSasuke's humanoid Susanoo bears a great resemblance to Raideen the Brave, one of a number of Yoshiyuki Tomino references in the series (another being the Gundam-derived names of Kakuzu's techniques).\nShisui's Susanoo resembles the eponymous mecha from the anime Steel Jeeg.\nDespite Madara, Indra, Sasuke and Kakashi all being shown to manifest a stabilised Susanoo in the manga, only Madara is listed as a user of the Complete Body — Susanoo in the fourth databook.[17]\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, Madara's Susanoo swords are capable of spinning, giving them a drill-like ability.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Itachi and Shisui's Susanoo are given Complete Body — Susanoo forms, designed by Kishimoto himself, making it so all known Susanoo users have access to its highest form across different media. Also in the game, Madara's Limbo clones possess the ability to use Susanoo, while Madara himself, empowered as the Ten-Tails jinchūriki, was shown using a larger form of the Complete Body — Susanoo. For an Ultimate Jutsu, the version of Sasuke from The Last: Naruto the Movie manifests a Susanoo arm in the place of his own missing arm.\nIndra's Susanoo was given its unique name in Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu.\nSee Also[]\nCat God Possession: Monster Cat Beckoning Technique\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Third Databook, pages 274-275\n\n↑ Boruto episode 204\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 464, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 589, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 477, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 647, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 552, pages 1-2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 560, pages 12-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 580, pages 3-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 585, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 560, pages 12-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 466, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 392\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 658, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 463, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 476, pages 13-14\n\n↑ 17.0 17.1 17.2 Fourth Databook, page 245\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 695, pages 13-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 648, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 696, page 11\n\n↑ Volume 58 cover\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 138\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 585, pages 14-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 551, page 12\n\n↑ Volume 51 cover\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 464, page 17\n\n↑ 27.0 27.1 Naruto chapter 484, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 553, pages 15-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 677, page 14\n\n↑ The name comes from the Studio Pierrot blog.\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 476\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto the Movie\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 477\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 465, pages 1-3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 648, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 676, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 579, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 634, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 696, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 695, page 19\n\n↑ Volume 62 cover\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 588, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 620, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 577, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 322\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 589, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 563, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 670, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 468\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 689, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 689, pages 1-2\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 462\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 214\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 462, page 6"}

The moment the brush is removed from the scroll, the images leap from the paper, grow to life-size, and act according to the user's will. Because they are made of ink, a single blow is usually enough to dispel them. For discreet communiques while undercover, Sai is able to turn the words he writes into small animals, allowing them to travel unnoticed to the intended target, after which the ink animal requires a scroll to revert back into written information.[2] In addition to the animals it is normally used to create, Sai can produce explosive tags.[3] In the anime, for the drawings to retain stability upon emerging, the user's emotional state must have a true passion for them. Otherwise, the drawings will immediately splatter.[4]\n\n\nList of Drawings[]\nSai's[]\nTomoe Lion (巴獅子, Tomoe Shishi)[5] - for attacking from a distance. They are usually created in small groups as Wild Lions (乱獅子, Ranjishi)[6] to attack foes directly.Hawk (鷹, Taka)[7] - can be ridden for reconnaissance or high-speed travel. Smaller variants can be used to carry explosive tags or be used to deliver messages.Rat (鼠, Nezumi)[7] - can swarm across an area to search for a target much faster than the user would be able to on their own. Being so small, the rats are inconspicuous, also making them suitable for covert message delivery.Snake (蛇, Hebi)[6] - can be used as ropes to restrain someone. With the ability to soundlessly enter through even the smallest crevice, they can also be used for assassination purposes.Tiger - as with lions, this tiger be used to swarm a target and attack. Also used for sealing his enemy.Dragon (龍, Ryū)[5], used in the anime's Power arc.Bat,[7] seen in the anime - can morph into a makeshift umbrella, or attach themselves to the enemy's face and blind them.Fish, seen in the anime - Useful in delivering messages in water.Leech, seen in the anime - Larger and heavier leeches can also be drawn.Crab imitation of the Gatekeeper, seen in The Last: Naruto the Movie.Cat, rabbit, and squirrel, seen in the anime.Owl, seen in Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds.\nInojin's[]\nDog.Hawk, used for transportation and picking up objects.Sparrow, used for distractions and delivering messages.Lizard, used for intimidation.Anomalocaris, used to detonate.Shoebill, used for transportation.\nInfluences[]\nThis technique is in reference to the Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga (lit. Animal-person Charicatures), or Chōjū-giga for short, a set of four picture scrolls belonging to the Kōzan-ji Temple in Kyōto, Japan and sometimes credited as the first manga. The scrolls depict various anthropomorphic animals dancing and playing about in a lively ceremony, which seems to be the basis for Sai being able to animate his own drawings for various purposes.\n\n     Two different aesthetic designs used for the technique.  \nInojin Yamanaka's usage of the technique differs from his father's in terms of the aesthetic design. Unlike Sai's round drawings, Inojin's have sharp, straight lines. Inojin remarked that his father's sense of style appears to be \"old-fashioned\" compared to his own.[8] Appropriately, his design is named Super Beast Imitating Drawing: Modern Era (超獣偽画・現代, Chōjū Giga: Gendai).[9]\n\nTrivia[]\nAccording to both users of this technique, it does not work as well in rain.[10] Despite this, in the anime, Sai was shown using this technique to create a fish and an umbrella.[11]\nIn Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles, Rock Lee was able to paint mice with the head of Might Guy. Tenten painted a large, \"cute\", humanoid bunny and panda bear. Sai still had to perform the technique to animate their drawings.\nIn the anime, Inojin uses coloured ink for his Super Beast Imitating Drawing creatures in addition to the black ink Sai uses.\nIn the anime, Sai noted that Boruto Uzumaki's passion and love of his drawings could possibly make him well-suited for this technique.[4]\nIn the anime, because the drawings are animated with his chakra and move around, Inojin can use them to extend the range of his Sensing Technique.[12]\nIn Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 9, Nine-Tails, Inojin's use of this technique is called Super Beast Cartoon Drawing (超獣戯画, Chōjū Giga). Whether this is a mistake or a new jutsu is unknown.\nSee Also[]\nC1\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, pages 286-287\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 457, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 520, page 19\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Boruto episode 33\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2\n\n↑ 7.0 7.1 7.2 Naruto Collectible Card Game\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 700+1, page 10\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Volume 2's Inojin's Profile\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 573, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 81\n\n↑ Boruto episode 177"}

The first gate takes the attack head-on, the second reduces the attack's power and the third disperses the pressure, causing all attacks that come in contact with it to lose their power before they can be effective.

It appears that Ibiki can control the force of the gears using hand seals and chakra, using it as a method of torture and interrogation. He is also able to perceive the pain of the victim.\n\nTrivia[]\nThe statue which crowns the torture chamber is of Fukusuke, the Japanese god of merchant prosperity. One of the lesser known luck gods, statues of Fukusuke can sometimes be found at the entrances to businesses, similar to the maneki neko statue in Ibiki's Summoning: Iron Maiden technique.

{"jutsu_name":"Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"Unlike the usual practice of summoning an entire creature, the user instead summons only the oesophagus of a giant toad from Mount Myōboku: Rock Lodging (妙木山・岩宿, Myōbokuzan: Iwayado). The oesophagus is summoned around a target; if this is done inside a cave or some other structure, it's possible the target will not even notice. The walls of the oesophagus are sticky and pliable, making it difficult for opponents to keep their footing and, therefore, fight as normal. The oesophagus is ordinarily inescapable, and over time it will contract around and digest its victims.[1]\nJiraiya can control the oesophagus, causing it to expand, contract, or grow in whatever direction he wishes. When first used, Jiraiya claims that no one has ever escaped from this technique. Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki manage to escape when Itachi burns through the oesophagus using Amaterasu. This surprises Jiraiya, as the oesophagus is fire-resistant due to the toad's ability to breathe fire.[2]\nIn the anime, Jiraiya demonstrates the ability to summon a giant toad's stomach using this technique. This section of the toad contains stomach acid, and the air within is filled with an acidic poison that is colourless and odourless, making it difficult to detect. Though it can be endured in small amounts, this poison begins to paralyse a person's entire body after ten minutes of continuous exposure, indiscriminately affecting anyone contained within the stomach.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nGamaguchi (蝦蟇口, literally meaning: toad mouth) is a Japanese name for a pouch or wallet, especially one closed with a metal clasp and used for small change.

The stronger the attack, the more damage the attacker will do to themselves when they try and fail to break through the gate.[1] Sakon and Ukon praise Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru for being able to dent the gate, which they say is Orochimaru's strongest defence.[2] Despite this, Orochimaru can also use a three gate variant, and beyond that is a five gate variant.\nIn the anime, this gate possesses offensive capabilities, with launchers installed in the roof-tiles that fire swarms of blades via a chain mechanism. However, launching too many of them near its base will cripple its foundation and the gate will collapse.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe summoned Rashōmon is based off the main gate of old Kyōto with the demonic face inspired by the legend that Kyōto's Rashōmon was the home of an oni named Ibaraki-dōji.\nIn some Naruto video games, this technique is used offensively, the gate being summoned directly beneath the target.

Because of how extensive this technique's damage and how wide an area it covers, it is most useful against hiding opponents or when the user is surrounded. The terrain is left flattened afterwards, which also means the user's location is exposed.[1]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe reading of the name of this technique is a Japanese expression that means \"whirling; going round and round; rushing a person off his feet\".\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Tō no Sho, page 211\n\n↑ Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 214"}

The greatest advantage of this technique is that the time between taking out a ninja tool, taking the right stance and actually throwing it is greatly reduced. Also when a weapon such as a fūma shuriken is summoned, the time needed to throw it can be further shortened by having prepared the weapon in its fully extended form beforehand.\nThe ninja tools are thrown with the speed of a flash of lightning, ruining the opponent's outset of the battle, and snatching away the initiative. Furthermore, because the summoned ninja tools can remain hidden until right before they are used, if this technique is mastered, there are an exceptional number of possible tactics. A large number of ninja tools can be stored within the sealing marks, which can make the efficiency of this technique last longer.\n\nTrivia[]\nSasuke's bracelets are beige in the manga and purple in the anime.[2]\nIn the manga, Sasuke later applied this seal as a tattoo on his wrist.[3]\nSee Also[]\nUnsealing Technique: Shuriken\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 251\n\n↑ Volume 43 cover\n\n↑ Sasuke Retsuden, chapter 8.2, page 5"}

{"jutsu_name":"Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu, Reincarnation Ninjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation is a jutsu that binds the soul of a deceased person to a living vessel, restoring them as they were in the last moments of their lives in order to do their summoner's bidding. It was originally created by Tobirama Senju, some time after which he declared it a kinjutsu. Orochimaru would discover the technique decades later and improve on its use, while his subordinate Kabuto Yakushi nearly perfected it.\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n\n1.1 Control\n\n\n2 Attributes\n\n2.1 Enhancements\n\n\n3 Countering\n4 Known Reincarnated\n\n4.1 Orochimaru\n4.2 Kabuto Yakushi\n\n\n5 Trivia\n6 See Also\n7 References\n\n\nUsage[]\n    The seal for the ritual.  \nBefore this technique can be performed, the user must first acquire some of the DNA of the person they intend to reincarnate. Kabuto remarks that this basically amounts to grave-robbing, although blood stains or organs salvaged after the target's death also work.[2] The soul of the intended reincarnated must also reside in the Pure Land; souls trapped in the stomach of the Shinigami, for example, cannot be reincarnated so long as they reside there.[3] A living sacrifice is also required for the reincarnated soul to use as a vessel.[2] If the souls are readily available in the Impure World, such as was the case with the first four Hokage who were freshly freed from the Shinigami's stomach, they can be reincarnated through this technique.[3]\n\n     Torune being reincarnated with Fū as the sacrifice.  \nTo actually perform the Impure World Reincarnation, the DNA of the person to be reincarnated is smeared on a special scroll. Once the scroll is activated, the remains spread out in the form of a special seal with the living sacrifice in the centre. Then dust and ash encase the sacrifice's body, giving them the same appearance that the reincarnated had at the time of their death; the process is apparently painful for the sacrifice.[2] The sacrifice's chakra signature is completely overridden with the chakra of the one being reincarnated. Although the sacrifice is still technically alive so long as the technique is active, their body will never again be theirs and the body will die when the reincarnated soul is released.\nAlthough Tobirama was the technique's creator, his usage had two flaws: the reincarnated souls were greatly diminished in power compared to when they were alive and he could only control a small number at a time.[4] Orochimaru was able to somewhat mitigate both flaws, though the power they possessed still wasn't anywhere close to when they were alive. It was only upon his revival that Orochimaru was able to summon beings who were much closer to their original level of power. Ultimately, it is Kabuto who almost completely eliminates the flaws, bettering the Impure World Reincarnation to such a degree that the reincarnations are almost perfectly returned to how they were during life and he can control as many at a time as he wishes to, resources permitting.[2] His improvements, combined with the fact that performing the Impure World Reincarnation requires no chakra from the user, causes Kabuto to declare it the most powerful jutsu in history.[4]\nReincarnations can be mobilised like standard infantry, where they must travel to their destination. Alternatively, coffins that contain them can be summoned to a location, assuming someone is there to perform the summoning; the anime does not consistently require this.[5] Reincarnations can be recalled in a similar way, with a coffin emerging around them to take them back.\n\nControl[]\n     The talisman used to control the reincarnated.  \nThe only discretion a user needs to exercise for the Impure World Reincarnation is how much control to exert over the reincarnated soul. After first performing it the user is only able to restrict their movements. In general, this limited control is not an issue for the summoner, and they will typically \"deactivate\" the reincarnation, placing them in a coffin for storage and transportation until they're needed. However, when the perfected Impure World Reincarnation is used to revive somebody, there comes a possibility that they will be strong enough to resist this control; Tobirama was able to resist this control prior to Orochimaru using Hashirama's cells to strengthen the binding and Orochimaru notes Hashirama Senju could break free if he chose to, even with the enhanced binding from Hashirama's cells.[6]\nIn order to actually be able to control their actions, the user must implant a special talisman - generally attached to the end of a kunai - within the reincarnation's brain. The talisman's design determines how strong the control is:\n\nAt its most basic, the reincarnated souls retain their personality, giving them the freedom to approach a given task however they like so long as it broadly carries out the summoner's bidding. On the one hand, this makes them more useful in combat because they know how best to use their own abilities[7] and, if deployed against somebody they knew when they were alive, there is a possibility for psychological warfare.[8] On the other hand, although they are compelled to do as their summoner wishes and act without reluctance,[9] they can undermine their summoner to a degree, either by making poor decisions that opponents can take advantage of or by giving opponents advice about how to defeat them.[10] Despite its risks, Kabuto prefers this level of control.\nAt its strongest level, the reincarnated soul's personality is entirely eliminated. The summoner instead controls all of their actions, even permitting them to speak through the reincarnation[11] or summon other reincarnated souls to their location. Although this guarantees the reincarnated soul will only ever act as desired, they are less resourceful and it requires the summoner's attention for every action that must be taken, making it difficult for them to multi-task depending on the circumstances. Orochimaru prefers this level of control. Kabuto has at times rewritten talismans remotely in order switch to this level of control when the situation calls for it.[12]\nKabuto and Orochimaru are able to strengthen the bindings they use through external means: Kabuto siphons chakra from the cursed seal Anko Mitarashi is branded with;[12] Orochimaru uses Senju cells.[13] On a related note, any level of control creates a traceable chakra signature between the reincarnated soul and their summoner, allowing reincarnated sensors to trace the summoner's location.[14]\n\nAttributes[]\n     Deidara being rejuvenated.  \nWhen first summoned, the body will appear grey and in a state of minor decay: marred by cracks and other imperfections. If the summoner chooses to, they can rejuvenate the reincarnation while planting their control talisman, restoring their complexion and reducing some of the imperfections; this is merely aesthetic and the signs of decay do not inhibit their abilities. An unavoidable characteristic of a reincarnated body is the darkened sclerae, with a soul that retains its personality having grey sclerae and a soul with a suppressed personality having black sclerae.[4]\nA reincarnated individual will have all the abilities they had during their life, including kekkei genkai and kekkei tōta. They are physically restored as they were at the time of their death, including any physical handicaps they may have possessed, such as Nagato's damaged legs. Exceptions exist: illnesses they had will not be preserved, nor will any physical damage that contributed to their death. There is some inconsistency of whether or not foreign body matter will be restored as well: Hanzō retains the poison gland of the black salamander, but Madara Uchiha does not have access to Hashirama Senju's genetic material and thus Kabuto must artificially reproduce it for him.\nClothing is reproduced according to what they wore when they died, although it is merely a superficial aspect of their reincarnated body; armour offers no actual protection, being of the same ashen material as the rest of their body. Reincarnated members of Akatsuki are, however, outfitted with different cloaks than they used to wear. Weaponry is usually not retained and must instead be gathered by the summoner; the reincarnated Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist only have access to those swords Kabuto is able to acquire.[15] One exception seems to be the Gold and Silver Brothers' Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths, which are still seemingly stored within the brothers' bodies.[16]\nThe vast majority of the reincarnated were able to achieve the same power they had at life, such as Mū. But a few of the reincarnated, such as Madara Uchiha’s full abilities were limited by the technique. For example, even with the perfected Impure World Reincarnation; Madara's reincarnated body is successfully bound by the Sage Art: Gate of the Great God, which he easily breaks free of as soon as he is restored to life.[17] Likewise, there are some things a reincarnated body simply cannot do, such as access all the abilities of the Rinnegan or become the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails.[18]\n\nEnhancements[]\n     Tobirama using the Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags.  \nOne of the major benefits of the Impure World Reincarnation is that it grants immortal bodies to those who are reincarnated. Any damage they receive will regenerate in time and, assuming the damage is not too debilitating, they can continue attacking even before their body recovers. This was one of the main purposes Tobirama created the technique for, as he would use one or more reincarnated souls to perform a series of Kamikaze-like attacks until the opposition was wiped out;[19] he created the Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags specifically for this purpose. Reincarnated bodies do not bleed, except in those cases where blood is needed to perform the Summoning Technique.[20]\nA second benefit is the limitless refilling of their diminished chakra reserves that the reincarnated individuals have access to; they can fight eternally and perform ordinarily physically demanding or chakra-intensive jutsu without issue, knowing their current reserves will infinitely refill.[21] They are still subject to certain inherent demands of the jutsu itself, such as the Second Tsuchikage's chakra supply being cut in half after using the Fission Technique[22] or only being able to create a certain number of clones.[23] Other side-effects may still manifest, as when Itachi Uchiha's eyes bleed from using his Mangekyō Sharingan, but he is not inhibited by it.\nThe reincarnated body can be further enhanced to \"beyond their prime\". When Madara Uchiha was brought back, Kabuto put his body through a selective evolution, combing the best attributes from different points of his life. In addition to his body being restored to its physical prime rather than the withered state it had when he died, he also retained the various abilities he gained only during the last years of his natural life; he retained the graft of Hashirama Senju's DNA so he could still access the First Hokage's abilities, and he has access to dōjutsu he gave up during his life.[24] The reincarnated jinchūriki similarly have their respective tailed beasts sealed back into them.[25]\nReincarnated individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.[26]\n\nCountering[]\n     Itachi Uchiha's soul ascending.  \nKilling the summoner does not release the Impure World Reincarnation, and in fact that can be considered inadvisable.[27] There are only three guaranteed ways to end the technique:[4]\n\nRemove the soul from the reincarnated body, such as with the Dead Demon Consuming Seal.\nHave the summoner end the technique. As they are unlikely to do this voluntarily, using a genjutsu to trick them into cancelling the technique is ideal. The sequence of hand seals for cancelling the technique is Rat → Ox → Monkey → Tiger → Dragon → Boar and saying \"release\" (解, kai).[28] (When demonstrating the technique to Tobi, Kabuto lied that the seals to release it are Dog → Horse → Tiger.)[4] The Sage of the Six Paths has demonstrated the ability to release the Impure World Reincarnation despite not being the summoner.[29]\nA less reliable, though equally effective method is to have the reincarnated soul be affected in some emotional way that gives them closure, allowing their soul to break free of the Impure World Reincarnation's influence.[30]\nWhen a soul is released from the Impure World Reincarnation, their body disintegrates back into dust and the sacrifice's corpse will be left lying in the debris. The soul may linger briefly - with their personality restored if it was being suppressed - to leave parting words or take final actions. Souls released by their summoner will be enveloped in light throughout the process.[31]\nEven if the Impure World Reincarnation cannot be broken conventionally, reincarnated bodies can still be neutralised. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, the Allied Shinobi Forces develop the method of binding the reincarnations' bodies so that they can't move and then placing a seal on the bindings so that they no longer pose a threat. The Benihisago and Kohaku no Jōhei are able to seal the reincarnated bodies to such a degree that even the release of the jutsu won't affect the seal. Yin–Yang Release, as manifested in Truth-Seeking Balls, can negate the regenerative properties of reincarnated bodies, reducing their effectiveness and, if used to strike a vital spot, kill them for all intents and purposes.[32] The spirits of those reincarnated by the technique will remain damaged even if the jutsu is released, as shown with Minato Namikaze. Itachi also used his Sword of Totsuka to seal Nagato, his ultimate fate unclear after Itachi had Kabuto released the technique.\nThere are also other instances of a reincarnated body escaping their summoner's influence. Itachi Uchiha was targeted with Kotoamatsukami by Shisui's eye transplanted into a crow which was stored in Naruto, displacing Kabuto's commands with different orders.[33] Kabuto can regain control of Itachi by gaining access to the control talisman,[34] and in fact is still able to release him from the Impure World Reincarnation. Conversely, if the reincarnated soul knows the hand seals, they can sever the summoner's contract with them; in the anime, the seals are Snake → Ram → Boar → Dog → Tiger.[35] This grants them full control of their own actions, all the benefits of an immortal body, and prevents the summoner from releasing them from the Impure World Reincarnation. Madara Uchiha describes this as \"the one risk of the technique\".[21] Another way to take over the control of reincarnated bodies is through the usage of the Six Paths Technique, as in the case of Obito's Six Paths jinchūriki. Because of Obito's Black Receivers being embedded into the left side of each jinchūriki's chests, he was able to wrest Kabuto's control over the revived jinchūriki, and thus control the revived jinchūriki's near-perfectly. However, it should be noted that Kabuto is still able to release them from the Impure World Reincarnation.\n\nKnown Reincarnated[]\nOrochimaru[]\n\n\nName\n\nVillage of origin\n\nSacrifice used\n\n\nHashirama Senju\nKonohagakure\nKin Tsuchi/White Zetsu clone\n\n\nHiruzen Sarutobi\nKonohagakure\nWhite Zetsu clone\n\n\nMinato Namikaze\nKonohagakure\nWhite Zetsu clone\n\n\nOsoi (Anime only)\nKumogakure\nKonohagakure shinobi\n\n\nThird Kazekage (Anime only)\nSunagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nTobirama Senju\nKonohagakure\nZaku Abumi/White Zetsu clone\n\n\nYota (Anime only)\nUnknown\nUnknown\n\nNotes\nDuring the Konoha Crush, Orochimaru attempted to reincarnate Minato Namikaze, unaware that his soul did not reside in the Pure Land.

He should've noticed that that's impossible when he had to do the first summoning (the one with the ritual).\nIn the anime, Orochimaru's reincarnation of Osoi was an accident, as he intended to reincarnate Toroi.\nKabuto Yakushi[]\n\n\nName\n\nVillage of origin\n\nSacrifice used\n\n\nA\nKumogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nAmeyuri Ringo\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nAsuma Sarutobi\nKonohagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nBlue B (Anime only)\nKumogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nChen (Anime only)\nKonohagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nChiyo\nSunagakure\nKonohagakure shinobi\n\n\nChūkaku (Anime only)\nFire Temple\nUnknown\n\n\nChūkichi\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nDan Katō\nKonohagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nDaimaru (Anime only)\nSunagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nDeidara\nIwagakure\nKonohagakure shinobi\n\n\nFū\nTakigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nFuguki Suikazan\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nGari\nIwagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nGengetsu Hōzuki\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nGinkaku\nKumogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nHaku\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nHan\nIwagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nHanzō\nAmegakure\nUnknown\n\n\nHayate Gekkō (Anime only)\nKonohagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nHeiji (Anime only)\nAmegakure\nKonohagakure shinobi\n\n\nHizashi Hyūga\nKonohagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nInabi Uchiha (Anime only)\nKonohagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nItachi Uchiha\nKonohagakure\nKonohagakure shinobi\n\n\nJinin Akebino\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nJinpachi Munashi\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nJirōbō (Anime only)\nOtogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nKakuzu\nTakigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nKidōmaru (Anime only)\nOtogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nKimimaro\nOtogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nKinkaku\nKumogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nKumo Reincarnated Shinobi (Anime only)\nKumogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nKushimaru Kuriarare\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nMadara Uchiha\nKonohagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nMangetsu Hōzuki\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nMū\nIwagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nNagato\nAmegakure\nUnknown\n\n\nOsoi (Anime only)\nKumogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nPakura\nSunagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nRasa\nSunagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nRōshi\nIwagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nSakon and Ukon (Anime only)\nOtogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nSasori\nSunagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nShin\nKonohagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nSuna Reincarnated Shinobi (Anime only)\nSunagakure\nUnknown\n\n\nTatewaki (Anime only)\nLand of Iron\nUnknown\n\n\nTayuya (Anime only)\nOtogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nTonika Village Head (Anime only)\nTonika Village\nUnknown\n\n\nToroi\nKumogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nTorune Aburame\nKonohagakure\nFū Yamanaka\n\n\nUtakata\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nYagura Karatachi\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\n\nYota (Anime only)\nUnknown\nUnknown\n\n\nYugito Nii\nKumogakure\nUnknown\n\n\nZabuza Momochi\nKirigakure\nUnknown\n\nNotes\nKabuto mentions his desire to reincarnate certain shinobi:[2]\nJiraiya, though his body lies at the bottom of the ocean where the water pressure is too great to reach. However, he claimed that the bloodstains on the Six Paths of Pain's weapons may provide enough DNA. Tobi denies him this request on the basis that doing so would be \"pushing [his] luck\".\nShisui Uchiha, but Kabuto could not find his body. He suggested that one of Shisui's eyes that was crushed by Danzō Shimura, whose corpse was in Tobi's possession, would be sufficient. As with Jiraiya's case, Tobi threatened him not to push his luck.\nIn the anime, Kabuto planned to reincarnate Baki, if he died during his fight with Hayate Gekkō.[37]\nIn the anime, Kabuto's reincarnation of Chūkaku and Heiji are accidents, as he intended to reincarnate Chiriku and Hanzō, respectively.\nKabuto deploys these and other mistaken reincarnations to try and release more important reincarnations from their bindings. As most are no stronger than genin, they all fail.[38]\nTrivia[]\n     The pebbles and grid Kabuto uses.  \nKabuto is seen using a grid to keep track of all the reincarnated individuals he controls, with a pebble representing each shinobi.[4] It is not clear if there is some actual connection between the grid and those he reincarnates or if it's a mere convenience for him. In the anime, the pebbles crumble when the reincarnation is sealed. All of the pebbles are light-coloured except for Madara Uchiha's, whose is black.[39] In the anime, the failed reincarnations are represented by piles of sand.[38]\n\"Edo\" (穢土, literally meaning: Dirty Soil) is what Japanese Buddhists call the normal world, where unenlightened people live. The current, living world. The world of the people who have not yet have escaped the polluting thoughts (greed, hatred, delusion, etc.) that result in suffering.\nA possible translation of Tensei is \"Resurrection\". In terms of this technique, both \"Reincarnation\" and \"Resurrection\" can be found; the sacrificed body is reincarnated into the body of the summoned shinobi, while the reincarnated shinobi is resurrected from the dead.\nIn Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2, Orochimaru reincarnates the Third Hokage despite his soul not being in the Pure Land.\nOrochimaru also reincarnates Zabuza and Haku to aid him in a second Konoha Crush.\nDuring the original Naruto anime, a reincarnated target's eyes appear normal, albeit glazed over.[36] In Naruto: Shippūden, the eyes are corrected to match the manga.\nStarting in Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations, Kabuto Yakushi (Snake Cloak Form) uses the Impure World Reincarnation as his ultimate technique. He summons Kakuzu, Itachi, and Deidara, who attack the opponent using the Lightning Release: False Darkness, Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique, and C1, respectively.\nIn the anime, when eradicating the personality of Hanzō, Kabuto used several hand seals instead of just one.[40]\nIn Konoha Shinden: Steam Ninja Scrolls, Ryūki claimed to have redesigned this technique as a means to communicate with the dead without actually sacrificing anyone. This was ultimately a lie to gather sacrifices for his goal in gaining immortality from Jashin.\nIn the anime within Tsunade's Infinite Tsukuyomi dream, Sasori used this technique to revive an army of shinobi puppeteers, which could all use Red Secret Technique: Performance of a Hundred Puppets.[41]\nIn Sasuke Retsuden: The Uchiha Descendants and the Heavenly Stardust, Zansūru claimed that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant of Redaku Reincarnation Ninjutsu. Decades prior to Sasuke's time in the Astronomy Research Institute, Orochimaru visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon Tobirama's Impure World Reincarnation.\nSee Also[]\nBody Recreation Technique\nEarth Release Resurrection Technique: Corpse Soil\nRedaku Reincarnation Ninjutsu\nReferences[]\n\n↑ First Databook, page 181\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Naruto chapter 520\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 618, pages 13-17\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 Naruto chapter 521\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 318\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 620, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 513, pages 2 and 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 516, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 548, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 557\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 560, page 2\n\n↑ 12.0 12.1 Naruto chapter 522\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 620, pages 9-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 577, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 523, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 527, pages 1-3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 656, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 614, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 561, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 548, page 17\n\n↑ 21.0 21.1 Naruto chapter 591, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 553, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 637, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 560, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 565, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 677\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 577, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 589, pages 8-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 691, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 518, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 589, pages 12-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 642, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 550, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 582, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 340\n\n↑ 36.0 36.1 Naruto episode 69\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 307\n\n↑ 38.0 38.1 Naruto: Shippūden episode 316\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 575, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 272\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 449"}

The statue's mouth then emitted chakra in the form of a dragon capable of extracting the chakra of anything it touched, killing humans immediately. After serving its purpose, the statue disappeared while the receivers broke off and remained embedded in Nagato's back.[5]\n\nInfluences[]\nAs with many of Nagato's techniques, it is influenced by Buddhist terminology. Gedō (外道, literally meaning: Outer Path), derived from the Sanskrit Tīrthika, refers to any doctrine which \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the Naidō (内道, literally meaning: Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical.\nTrivia[]\nBoth Obito and Madara were able to summon the statue without any adverse effects, instead utilising an offering of blood. When they use this technique, they refer to it simply as \"Summoning Technique\".[6][7]\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, Obito summons the Demonic Statue which then launches bolts of chakra at the opponent.\nIn the anime, when unconsciously summoned by Nagato, the statue didn't drain his life force.[8]\nSee Also[]\nSealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Fourth Databook, page 247\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 606, pages 13-14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 659, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 606, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 447, pages 7-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 536, pages 15-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 659, pages 3-4\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 347"}

In the case of the toads, the contract is a scroll that the summoner signs their name to using their own blood and further marks with the fingerprints of one of their hands.[3] Orochimaru has the snakes' contract tattooed to his arms, which he smears with blood each time he wants to perform a summoning.[4] A user can summon different species provided they have signed the respective contracts, as Sasuke Uchiha is able to summon snakes and hawks[5] while Konohamaru Sarutobi can summon toads and monkeys.[6] Contracts remain active even after death, allowing those revived with the Impure World Reincarnation to perform summons they established when they were alive.[7]\nTo actually summon an animal, users apply some of their blood to the hand they signed the contract with. Usually they bite one of their fingers to accomplish this, but blood from injuries elsewhere on their body can also be used. They press the hands' five fingers down and channel chakra to the hand, summoning the animal to that location.[8] While usually pressing them at the ground, it is also possible to do so on no surface at all, such as midair. The amount of chakra gathered in the hand determines the size and number of animals that are summoned: if too little chakra is offered, only a small, young animal will be summoned;[4] by offering large amounts of chakra, multiple adult animals can be summoned simultaneously.[9] Two people who have signed the same contract can pool their chakra to summon especially large animals.[10] If an individual has access to the blood of someone who has signed an animal's contract, they can use the blood to summon the animal; the individual will need to provide their own chakra, however.[11]\nAnimals are typically summoned in order to lend assistance to their summoner, either by carrying out tasks or joining them in combat. Summoners will sometimes use their summons as a base for other jutsu, as with Summoning: Food Cart Destroyer Technique and Summoning: Quick Beheading Dance.[12][13] Summoned animals are not actually required to do anything and may choose instead to harm their summoner; Manda routinely threatens to kill his summoners.[14] Animals can even refuse their summoner's attempt to summon them by sending another of their species in their place.[15] Animals are not summoned indefinitely and will return to wherever they were summoned from when they tire out and/or enough time has passed.[16] Summoners can take advantage of this by riding along when their summon returns home, granting them a quick means of escaping an area.[11]\nHaving the Rinnegan allows the user to circumvent several of the Summoning Technique's normal limitations. Using the Animal Path, Rinnegan users can summon dozens of different animals (and even people) without the need for blood. It is only with the Rinnegan that the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path can be summoned, whose actions are directly controlled by the Rinnegan user.[17] Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki — the originator of the Rinnegan — is able to summon five people and the nine tailed beasts from Kaguya's Dimensions,[18] though he needs the chakra of seventeen dead Kage to do so.[19]\nIt is also possible to summon naturally occurring, non-sentient phenomena. Koji Kashin has summoned the flames from the Flaming Mountains (火焔山, Kaenzan) in battle, as their non-chakra origin prevents them from being absorbed.[20]\n\nKnown Summoning Domains[]\nMount Myōboku (Toads)\nRyūchi Cave (Snakes)\nShikkotsu Forest (Slugs)\nTrivia[]\n\"Kuchiyose\" (口寄せ, literally meaning: drawing in to speak) refers to the practice of allowing spirits to possess one's body and speak through it.\nA technique formulae (術式, jutsushiki) is produced at the hand's location when a summoning is performed. Like with seals, these formulae are a random assortment of Kanji, Hindi script, and other symbols.\nAnimals can summon those who have signed contracts with them using the Reverse Summoning Technique.[21]\nKurama can apparently identify who is trying to summon it,[22] something other summons have not been able to do.[23] Similarly, any person who has summoned Kurama must continually provide their own chakra in order to keep it under their control.[24]\nIn the anime, Shiromari is summoned for a fifty year period because of a scroll left by its summoner before they died. When the scroll was destroyed, Shiromari was finally able to return home.[25]\nIn the Naruto: Shippūden anime, attempting to summon an animal without first signing a contract teleports the user to the home of the animal they have a natural affinity for.[26] In the Boruto anime, attempting to do this simply results in failure.[27]\nIn the anime, when the Animal Path performed the Summoning Technique onto Ibiki Morino's abdomen, it caused him tremendous pain as the Giant Drill-Beaked Bird burst forth from his backside.[28]\nSee Also[]\nList of summons\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Rin no Sho, page 182\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 92, page 18, panel 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 92, page 18\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 165, pages 18-19\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 477, page 9\n\n↑ Boruto episode 119\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 530, page 14\n\n↑ Hyō no Sho, page 163\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 430, pages 2-3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 650, page 6\n\n↑ 11.0 11.1 Naruto chapter 363\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 124, pages 9-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 214, pages 15-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 171, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 634, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 642, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 606, pages 12-14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 690, pages 14-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 686, page 1\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 46\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 409, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 561, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 96, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 502 page 13-17\n\n↑ Naruto episode 194\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 127\n\n↑ Boruto episode 4\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 160"}

It allows the caster to instantaneously shrink themselves or any nonliving matter within their field of vision (or return the same to full size) at will.\n\nOverview[]\nSukunahikona allows the user to physically shrink down themselves and objects within their sight, even energy and chakra-based substances, though living beings other than the user cannot be affected. Because the change in size happens too fast for the human eye to see (and the shrunken size can be exceedingly small), use of the jutsu can easily be mistaken for teleportation. The technique cannot, however, be used on oneself if one is physically paralysed. Daikokuten can be used to store shrunken objects within an alternate dimension where time does not flow, allowing them to maintain a pristine condition.\nIsshiki Ōtsutsuki utilised Sukunahikona while on the verge of death after being betrayed by Kaguya, to enter the body of Jigen, which allowed him to survive as a parasite before ultimately taking over the monk's brain.\nIsshiki employs Sukunahikona in combat by shrinking his projectile attacks to keep his enemies from defending against them and then restoring them to their original size to inflict critical damage. He also uses the jutsu to dodge enemy attacks and free himself from restraints. He is still able to use Kāma's absorption in his shrunken state. He can also use the shrinking effect defensively against that which Kāma cannot absorb, such as reducing natural (non-chakra) flames that were engulfing him to a small size. The shrinkage is not limited to an object's entirety, as Isshiki can shrink a section of the target object, such as causing a building to cave in or removing a section of a rooftop.\nWhile inhabiting Jigen's body, this jutsu demanded that Isshiki make hand gestures in order to shrink foreign matter, but in his original form, Isshiki can achieve the effect merely by looking at desired objects.\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique is named after and inspired by Sukonabikona, the son of a primordial goddess of creation (Kamimusubi) whose name (meaning \"small lord of renown\") was due to him being a dwarf no bigger than a thumb.\nWhile Isshiki could not shrink living beings, he was able to shrink Jigen's body while still inhabiting it.

In becoming the perfect duplicate of another individual, he will even possess chakra identical to that of the one that he is impersonating along with any clothing they might be wearing or tools they may be carrying.[2] The clones can also use this technique to copy a target's abilities. Typically, White Zetsu would employ his parasite clones to serve as substitutes; he was able to control these clones remotely and remained aware of their actions and experiences.[3] The transformed clones can even retain the appearance of the person they were impersonating after death, reverting to its true form only after the technique was voluntarily released by the original White Zetsu.[2] Because the substitute is weaker than the original individual, their primary purpose is to function as a diversion.[2]\nIn an effort to increase Akatsuki's military power, Kabuto Yakushi conducted research with a captured Yamato to enhance the White Zetsu Army. In the anime, however, the army's clones were regularly shown using copied techniques and could endure prolonged battle.[4] Unlike the original's version, the technique is seemingly dispersed once the transformed soldier is dealt with a significant amount of damage or killed.[5][6] Additionally, these clones demonstrated the ability to partially revert to their true forms while transformed.[7][8]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the manga, the clone used as a substitute for Kisame Hoshigaki resembles a regular parasite clone.[2] In the anime, however, the clone possesses the Venus flytrap-like extensions that protrude from the side of the original White Zetsu, as well as the clothing that White Zetsu was wearing at the time.[9]\nIn both the manga and anime, the transformed clones were shown to bleed when damaged.

{"jutsu_name":"Strength of a Hundred Seal","jutsu_type":"Fūinjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Strength of a Hundred Seal is a jutsu from the Sage of Six Paths era,[3] that requires extremely delicate chakra control.[2] By storing a vast amounts of chakra over an extended period of time into a specific point on their body — usually the forehead — the user creates this seal, which manifests in the form of a rhombus-like marking. Once the seal is formed, the user's already impressive chakra control allows them to perform techniques without any wasted energy.[4] When released, the seal will either spread across the user's face or wrap around their entire body. The stored chakra is then released into their body, greatly amplifying the power of their techniques. The seal will permanently remain in the centre of the user's forehead, presumably so that the user can keep on benefiting from its effects.\nThis seal is also symbiotically linked to the summon Katsuyu, to either perform widespread healing of people, or communicating with the slug over long distances. That is to say: the power of the techniques used by Katsuyu, is directly proportional to the reserves of the seal.[5] By releasing the power of their seals, Tsunade and Sakura were able to combine its power with the Creation Rebirth technique in order to gain access to the Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique.\n\nTrivia[]\nWhen written as '白毫', byakugō means 'Ūrṇā' (literally meaning: Fine White Hair), which is a white swirl of fine hair on the forehead of the Buddha, represented in art by a spiral or a dot, or even a gem or pearl. It represents the third eye which allows one to see past the mundane world and into the divine world.\nMito Uzumaki had a similar marking on her forehead. While the Strength of a Hundred Seal seems to be modelled after this in terms of appearance, it is currently unknown if hers is also a Strength of a Hundred Seal.\nIn the chapters published in Shōnen Jump, the seal was initially identified as \"White Strength Seal\" (白豪の印, Byakugō no In). It was corrected in the tankōbon version.\nTsunade also uses a portion of the seal's chakra to maintain her youthful appearance.[4]\nSakura spent three years storing chakra to form the seal, something Tsunade's first disciple, Shizune, noted that even she was unable to achieve due to the level of chakra control required.[6]\nIn the anime, Tsunade stated that because of the delicate nature of building up chakra required for this technique, a person is substantially drained of normal reserves of chakra, making it dangerous for one to perform surgery or battle. Sakura, however, found a way to divert a small portion of that built-up chakra back into her normal reserves.[7]\nMitsuki claims Orochimaru has researched it, finding it to have a long and poorly understood history.[8]\nDue to similar appearances, Sarada Uchiha speculates there exists a connection between this seal and Kāma.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Second Databook, page 201\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 632, page 18\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 36, page 17\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 632, pages 15-18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 635, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 632, pages 12-15\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 408\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 35"}

This extra chakra will allow the user to utilise high level element ninjutsu. It also allows the user to use elemental techniques that they wouldn't be able to master normally. The chakra is not infinite, and must be replenished over time. Furthermore, only one type of elemental chakra can be injected into the person at a time, as Neji noted that Shizuku was seen with a completely different element from the previous encounter.\nThe person injected with these snakes can also force the snake out, and drink the chakra directly, vastly increasing their chakra and power, as well as inducing a body-mutating transformation (in Gitai's case, he became an Asura-like entity, with three faces, six-arms and a tail), but results in their body being highly unstable, which, if struck with sufficient force, can result in the body exploding.\nThe dark chakra snakes can also be used against the opponents. By injecting them with the same chakra, it can either paralyse or kill without leaving a mark.\n\nTrivia[]\nYomi claimed that Kusuna is the only one amongst the Gang of Four who could control the chakra snakes.\nWhen first used by Yomi, the chakra snakes emerged from the ground as long, glowing tubes that simply injected the Gang of Four with chakra, and then retracted. However, when used by Kusuna afterwards, they are shown as snakes that enter the other three's bodies via the back of the neck, which gave them a sense of exhilaration upon injection, and they gain markings over their bodies and, in Shizuku's case, her elbow extends."}

The water in the clone is surrounded by a thin layer of oil and due to this structure, the clone's temperature can easily be altered from cold to hot and vice-versa. When it exerts itself, the outer layer of oil heats up and evaporates the water inside. As the internal pressure builds, the clone expands until it violently explodes and the water vapour is released. The force of the explosion is great enough to completely destroy even durable constructs. This vapour then cools down as it rises and as a result, turns into hail that cools the clone, causing it to shrink to its original size and start the entire process again.[2]\nDespite its constantly increasing size, the clone itself remains very fast throughout the technique, enough to elude even Gaara's chakra-infused sand. This high-speed movement also allows it to heat up very quickly and to more easily inflict damage using an axe-like liquid blade that it is able to form on its arm. Throughout the duration of this technique, the Mizukage becomes weakened and vulnerable.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe name of this technique and its use of a \"youthful\" clone of the Second might be a reference to the famous Japanese animation film Steamboy, as the 'bōi' part is probably meant to imply the English word \"boy\" and \"jōki\" simply means \"steam\" when written as \"蒸気\".\nThe continuous cycle of this attack is very similar to that of the water cycle.\nSee Also[]\nC4\nClone Great Explosion\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 257\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 557, pages 1-3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 557, pages 4-5"}

They practice all night to synchronise Kakashi's Earth Release with Yamato's Wood Release, finding a configuration that is structurally sound but that also will reach the intended elevation within the one hour they'll be allotted.\nThe Spiralling Tower originally works as intended, with Kakashi's earth pillar and Yamato's wood pillar entwining in order to fortify each other as they grow into the sky. But a rainstorm begins shortly after they start, forcing Kakashi to spend additional chakra to reinforce the earth pillar against the rain and wind. The task eventually becomes too much for him and he loses sync with Yamato, briefly halting the tower's growth and potentially risking its destruction. Gaara and Kurotsuchi, whose assistance Kakashi requested the night before, arrive in time to assist, stabilising the tower that has been created so far and adding a sand pillar from Gaara and a second earth pillar from Kurotsuchi to its continued entwining growth.\nThe Spiralling Tower ends up being a success, with the three-man team that was ascending it reaching their destination in time. At the conclusion of the three's mission, an impact at the peak topples the tower and causes debris to start falling on Konoha. Gaara attempts to use his sand to shield the village, but he has no additional chakra to do so. A separate team of six ninja assembled specifically to deal with this potential debris begins to repel the initial chunks of the tower, but they are quickly overwhelmed.

Kidōmaru constantly sends his chakra along the threads, allowing him to sense anything that comes into contact with them; the threads are sensitive enough to even detect slight disturbances in the air. Because the threads appear no different than normal spiderwebs, they aren't likely to be noticed and thus are effective as an alert of approaching enemies.[1] Kidōmaru uses this technique while he and the rest of the Sound Four are resting, ensuring they won't be ambushed.[2] The touch threads, being stronger than wire, can also be used to reel in those who've contacted them.[3]\n\nSee Also[]\nArea Scanning Technique\nConcealed Sand Picture Cat\nRain Tiger at Will Technique\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Tō no Sho, page 215\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 185\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 186"}
{"jutsu_name":"Spider War Bow: Terrible Split","jutsu_type":"Hiden, Ninjutsu, Kyūjutsu","jutsu_description":"Kidōmaru first creates a war bow by carefully expelling Spider Sticky Gold from his mouth.[2] With it he is able to fire arrows, using his body's eight limbs to boost the bow's tension beyond what normal people are capable of. Because of how much power is put into each arrow, they travel incredibly quickly, too fast to see.[1] On impact, the arrows pierce cleanly through targets and obstacles alike and can crater the ground,[3] to the point that it is described as a \"one hit kill\". By activating his cursed seal's second level, Kidōmaru gains a third eye which further increases his accuracy, allowing him to hit his target's vital spots from hundreds of metres away.[1]\nWhen fighting Neji Hyūga, Kidōmaru initially uses a standard arrow without any special properties. By surrounding the area with his chakra, Neji is able to sense to arrow in time to avoid fatal injury.[3] To account for this, Kidōmaru attaches one of his usual spider threads to the arrow, allowing him to control its trajectory from up to fifty metres and thus improve its accuracy.[1] Neji takes shelter behind a tree to throw the arrow off course. To account for this, Kidōmaru modifies the arrowhead into a drill, which will allow it to pierce through the tree if Neji tries that again.[3] The combination of the new arrow and the guiding thread is enough to successfully strike Neji, which Neji uses as an opportunity to locate and kill Kidōmaru.[4] In the anime, after being reincarnated, Kidōmaru can simultaneously fire three arrows.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique's Japanese name is a pun, as when written as Suzaku (朱雀, literally meaning: Vermilion Bird), it is one of the sacred beasts of the Four Symbols in Chinese, Japanese and Korean mythology.\nWhile the databook states Kidōmaru boosts the tension of the bow with his eight spider limbs, which was what he did against Neji for the first shot, the next two shots he fired were only using two arms, despite retaining the same destructive force behind them.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Tō no Sho, page 214\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 195\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 Naruto chapter 196\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 197\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 305"}

It is very malleable when first created, but once it makes contact with the air it hardens rapidly, becoming as strong as steel. For this reason, if he intends to shape the substance into a particular form, he should do so before it's left his body, such as by chewing it into sharp projectiles that he extracts from his mouth. Alternatively, he can carefully shape it as he spits it out, as he does with the Spider War Bow: Terrible Split. These golden weapons are the core of Kidōmaru's offensive tactics, typically used for long-range attacks.[1] A property of the Spider Sticky Gold is that it is fortified against chakra, making techniques such as Gentle Fist unable to penetrate it.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Tō no Sho, page 217\n\n↑ Tō no Sho, page 264"}

The souls of both targets and users are separated from their bodies and confined to a special barrier. Sensor ninja and even the Byakugan cannot sense and see through this technique respectively. The targets are left in a state similar to suspended animation, still alive, but just barely, so much their chakra flow stops. To restore the trapped souls to their bodies, it is necessary to touch them with chakra. Inoichi Yamanaka likens this to a genjutsu cancel.\nInside the barrier, the souls of those trapped still feel like themselves, and are capable of using any techniques they know. Even if the casters of this technique are defeated it will not end. As such, it is only a matter of time before the life of those who are trapped by the barrier ends, as their physical bodies will eventually die.

Jirobo stated that utilising the second stage of the Cursed Seal makes them ten times more powerful than before.[1] However, Sakon comments that after using their cursed seal's second level and coming out of it, they lose a lot of energy.\nLater, in Part II of the anime, it was revealed that Orochimaru enhanced the power of their cursed seals, giving them the ability to use the Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover, a technique capable of trapping the souls of the user and the victim within an untraceable barrier, to fight with little to no interference. The technique however, would result in the user's death.

He becomes more spider-like, almost oni-like in appearance in this form. By opening the third eye on his forehead, his accuracy increases to the point of pinpointing Neji Hyūga’s Byakugan blind spot from a distance of over 50 metres.

The rods strike the ground at six points in his surroundings, and once the necessary hand seals are performed, they serve as the origin points for a gigantic red barrier.[2]\nLike its smaller counterpart, the barrier is highly malleable, being capable of withstanding the explosion of four enormous Tailed Beast Balls derived from the power of the Ten-Tails by dispersing their force upwards and into the sky.[3] However, as with similar techniques, the barrier can still be bypassed through the use of space–time ninjutsu such as the Flying Thunder God Technique.[4] The barrier's creator can also deactivate it at will, as well as apparently reactivate it at a later time if necessary.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nWhen Obito used this technique in the manga, the Truth-Seeking Ball behind his right hand permanently disappeared, implying it was converted into the black rods used to form the barrier.[2] However, in the anime, the orb remained after this technique's activation.[6]\nThe fourth databook makes no mention of this technique involving a Truth-Seeking Ball, instead stating that it utilises the Rinnegan's trademark black receivers.[1]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Jin no Sho, page 255\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 643, pages 9-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 644, pages 8-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 644, pages 12-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 646, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 380"}

{"jutsu_name":"Six Paths of Pain","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Fighting Style, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the technique which uses different bodies. For the original technique granted by the Rinnegan, see Six Paths Technique.\n\n\n\n\nThe Six Paths of Pain (ペイン六道, Pein Rikudō) is an Outer Path technique that allows a Rinnegan user to manipulate up to six bodies as though they are their own.\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Nagato's Paths\n3 Obito's Paths\n4 Influences\n5 Trivia\n6 See Also\n7 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nThe user embeds one or more black receivers into a body, allowing them to channel their chakra into it from great distances. To make full use of the body, the user ideally transmits their chakra from the highest and closest point possible so that they can have the best possible range.[1] Once their chakra enters the body, they are given complete control of it, allowing them to decide all of its actions, its use of jutsu, and even speak through it. As a representation of this control, the controlled bodies' eyes take on the same appearance as the user's.[2] Inoichi Yamanaka compared this technique to the Yamanaka clan's Mind Body Switch Technique, albeit on a greater scale.[1]\n\n     A first-person perspective of the Rinnegan's shared vision.  \nWhen multiple bodies are controlled together the user is able to see through all of their eyes, thus registering six separate fields of vision at the same time. With this shared vision, the user can coordinate their attacks and provide defences for their blind spots. For this reason, the Six Paths of Pain are strongest when used together, employing combination tactics, the element of surprise, and/or sheer overwhelming power to defeat their enemies.\nThe technique has a drawback. If the caster of the technique is interrupted in any way while transmitting chakra to the bodies being used as part of the technique, then all of the bodies will stop moving and become very vulnerable to attack.\n\nNagato's Paths[]\n     Nagato's Six Paths of Pain (with a new Animal Path).  \nNagato created the Six Paths of Pain after he was left crippled during a battle with Hanzō. Unable to move or act on his own, he controlled six corpses to carry out his will as part of his \"Pain\" identity.[3] In the anime, the first body used, belonged to his childhood friend Yahiko,[4] which was his favourite. To match his late friend's hair colour, he had the other Paths' hair dyed to the same colour, including eyebrows. Nagato's first Six Paths of Pain were composed of individuals that Jiraiya had met when they were alive. Nagato implants their black receivers all over their bodies as body piercings.\nEach of the Six Paths of Pain can be used to perform any technique that Nagato himself is capable of, however, he limits each body to one branch of the Six Paths Techniques, the exception being Yahiko's body (the Deva Path) through which he performs a number of miscellaneous jutsu; the King of Hell and the creatures summoned by the Animal Path are part of his shared vision. Nagato refers to each body by the Path it embodies and has them serve specific purposes, be it offensive or defensive, reconnaissance or repair. Each of the Paths has its own importance in a fight – the Naraka Path's ability to restore all the other Paths making it the most valuable – and therefore, Nagato will sacrifice other Paths to protect those further up the hierarchy.\nBecause of his lack of mobility, Nagato requires a great deal of preparation time to use his Six Paths of Pain, especially when moving outside his usual residence in Amegakure. Some of the Six Paths Techniques are very chakra-taxing, and in order to use them Nagato must either bring the respective body closer to his position[5] or alternatively cut off control of the other five Paths and focus all of his chakra into the one.[6] The greatest weakness of his Six Paths of Pain is that each body has only one primary ability; if an enemy has prior knowledge of what body does what, they stand a better chance of defeating the Paths. Sensors can track the chakra Nagato spends to control the paths back to him, exposing his real location. This is usually mitigated by Nagato's frequent changing of his chakra signature. It took Naruto stabbing himself with one of Nagato's black receivers to create a direct connection to track him with his Sage Mode sensing.\n\n     The room where the bodies are kept.  \nWhen not in use, Nagato stores the bodies in a hidden chamber within Amegakure's tallest tower. Within the room are six \"pods\", in which the bodies rested; each pod is connected to the wall via pipes or wires and has a sliding cover that appears to feature the symbol of Amegakure, which conceals the face of the inactive body. The pods are also numbered from one through six using daiji characters and are ordered counter-clockwise around the room with a numbering scheme that corresponds with the ordering of the six Buddhist Paths of Reincarnation:\n\n壱 (1) - Deva Path.\n弐 (2) - Asura Path.\n参 (3) - Human Path.\n四 (4) - Animal Path.\n五 (5) - Preta Path.\n六 (6) - Naraka Path.\nObito's Paths[]\n     Obito's Six Paths in partial transformations.  \nObito Uchiha creates his own Six Paths of Pain during the Fourth Shinobi World War using the reincarnated jinchūriki.[7] Obito controls his Six Paths using a single black receiver embedded into the left side of each of their chests, which were hidden from view. When transformed into the tailed beast, the receivers move from the chest to the neck. He also seals their respective tailed beast back into their bodies, which he maintains control of through the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.[8]\n\n     Obito forcing the jinchūriki into their full tailed beast forms.  \nObito can force the jinchūriki to transform into their full Tailed Beast Modes, but this carries an increased risk of the beasts subverting his commands.[9] Because of how much effort it requires to keep six tailed beasts under his control at once, Obito does not channel the Six Paths Techniques into his Six Paths of Pain.[10] Rather, he uses the same abilities that they had when they were alive, such as Rōshi's Lava Release and Utakata's Soap Bubble Ninjutsu. With Obito's Sharingan, through which he sees what his Paths see, he is able to more precisely synchronise and deploy their abilities.[11]\n\nInfluences[]\nBased upon the six Buddhist Paths of Reincarnation, each body was named after one of the different Paths: Deva, Asura, Human, Animal, Preta, and Naraka. Each of these Paths, or realms, represents one of the realms a being is reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives. While the two lower Paths, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher Paths, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be Paths of suffering because they perpetuate the cycle of Reincarnation; the only way to break it and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, Nagato's Six Paths spoke in Yahiko's voice, with the exception of Nagato's second Animal Path. The latter had a female voice as it was a woman.\nThree of Nagato's Six Paths of Pain are playable in Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, while the other three appear as support characters. All six are able to appear simultaneously in three-versus-one match-ups. The playable ones are Deva, Asura and Animal, the ones whose primary function is battle, rather than support.\nWhile talking to Tobi about the Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation technique, Kabuto Yakushi uses the term Pain of Six Paths (六道ペイン達, Rikudō Pein-tachi) to refer to the six bodies Nagato used to fight Jiraiya.[12]\nSee Also[]\nDead Soul Technique\nNine Masked Beasts\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Naruto chapter 428, pages 14-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 544, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 443, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 348\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 438, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 429, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 544, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 570, pages 2-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 567, pages 7-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 567, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 565, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 520"}

If they are able to find that strength of will, they'll obtain the power of a \"god that shapes the land\", essentially acquiring the power of the Sage of Six Paths.[1]\nUpon using the seal to become the Ten-Tails jinchūriki, Obito achieved two forms; in his initial form, his skin tone turned grey and his right half became scaly, he gained ten protrusions as well as the markings of the Sage of Six Paths on his back, and he obtained two Truth-Seeking Balls which floated behind his hands. After gaining control over the Ten-Tails, the protrusions on his back changed to resemble clothing, he gained a pair of horns on his head — the right being larger than the left — and his Truth-Seeking Balls increased to ten. In the anime, when Obito sealed the Ten-Tails, a circular shell encased his body and shattered once the transformation was complete. \nWhen Madara used this seal, his skin became grey and his hair turned white (taupe in Naruto: Colour Edition). Instead of possessing clothing-like flesh, Madara was instead cloaked with a complete outfit composed of chakra, with a pattern of six black magatama below his neck and the markings of the Six Paths Senjutsu on his back. A forehead protector-like appendage also emerged from the left side of his forehead, with an upward curve on its right side and a single horn on its left side. Like Obito, Madara obtained ten Truth-Seeking Balls. After using the seal to absorb the tree left behind by Obito, Madara gained additional magatama markings along the bottom and sleeves of his cloak.\n\nAbilities[]\nAs the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, the user gains immense increases in their physical capabilities and are able to completely overwhelm their powerful adversaries. Even when Obito initially had no control over himself, he was able to destroy the Hokage's barrier as well as Hashirama Senju's gates with ease, as well as overwhelm all four reincarnated Hokage. This power was amplified greatly upon having complete control of the Ten-Tails.\nWith it, Madara was able to fight on par against Might Guy using all Eight Gates and survive the latter's final attack. His speed was also greatly increased, able to counter a combination of individually fast techniques.[2] Madara's regenerative powers and durability are also greatly enhanced, able to survive the left side of his torso being obliterated[3] or being bisected[4] and soon after completely restore himself. With his immense regenerative powers, Madara claimed he had achieved complete immortality.[5]\n\nGallery[]\nObito's initial transformation after using the seal.Obito's final transformation.Madara's initial transformation after using the seal.Madara's transformation with the Ten-Tails' tree form absorbed also.\nTrivia[]\nWhen Obito revealed his plan at the Kage Summit, he stated that there was a fūinjutsu used to create jinchūriki that was passed down through the stone tablet beneath the Naka Shrine.[6] While it is unclear whether this was the jutsu used by Hagoromo to seal the Ten-Tails into himself, it is possible that this was the technique mentioned by Obito.\nThe Truth-Seeking Balls created through this technique are said to be similar to Tailed Beast Balls.[1]\nJin no Sho describes this technique as making the user's body into a yorishiro, an object with which to attract and house a deity.[1]\nAlongside the Limbo: Border Jail, Madara could not use this technique as a reincarnated corpse.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Fourth Databook, page 309\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 665, pages 11-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 672, pages 10, 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674, pages 15-16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 673, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 467, page 14-15"}
{"jutsu_name":"Six Paths Technique","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the original technique granted by the Rinnegan. For the technique which uses different bodies, see Six Paths of Pain.\n\n\n\n\nThe Six Paths Technique (六道の術, Rikudō no Jutsu) is the origin of the unique techniques bestowed by the Rinnegan. Those who wield the Rinnegan have access to each of these techniques.[2] Despite its name, there are actually seven of these techniques that grant the user powerful and near god-like abilities:\n\nThe Deva Path (天道, Tendō), which is able to manipulate attractive and repulsive forces.\nThe Asura Path (修羅道, Shuradō), which allows the user to augment their body with mechanised limbs, weaponry and armour.\nThe Human Path (人間道, Ningendō), which affords the ability to read a person's mind while also removing their soul.\nThe Animal Path (畜生道, Chikushōdō), which allows the user to summon a wide variety of creatures.\nThe Preta Path (餓鬼道, Gakidō), which is capable of absorbing all forms of chakra, including most ninjutsu.\nThe Naraka Path (地獄道, Jigokudō), through which the user can call upon the King of Hell.\nThe Outer Path (外道, Gedō), with which the user is able to preside over life and death.\nNagato, who was crippled early in his lifetime, utilised the Outer Path to create the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that he controlled as additional bodies through the use of black receivers. These bodies each possessed copies of the Rinnegan and the ability to use one aspect of the Six Paths Technique, thus compensating for Nagato's physical limitations. The Six Paths of Pain were each named after the ability Nagato channelled through them, while Nagato himself was regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path.[2] Obito Uchiha would later make use of this method to create his own Six Paths of Pain, this time using six former jinchūriki that were reincarnated by Kabuto Yakushi.[3]\nAs the main body's vision is linked to the Rinnegan possessed by the corpses, this method allows the user to easily coordinate their movements and also offers them a form of protection, as they can control the corpses from a distance, rather than putting their own body at risk. However, in order to use some especially chakra-taxing facets of the Six Paths Technique, the user must either cut off the flow of their chakra to all but one body, as in the case of the large-scale Shinra Tensei,[4] or bring the body close to their position, as in the case of Chibaku Tensei.[5] In contrast, when a Rinnegan wielder uses the Six Paths Technique with their own body, they are capable of using multiple abilities at once, and the strength of the techniques are greater.[6] It also does not seem that the user is able to change the Path being utilised by each body, as once each of Nagato's Six Paths were taken down, he could not channel any of their powers through the remaining vessels.\n\nInfluences[]\nThe Six Paths share their names with the six realms of reincarnation in Buddhism: Deva, Asura, Human, Animal, Preta, and Naraka. Each of these \"paths\" represents one of the realms a being may be reborn into after death, determined by the accumulated karma of their past lives. While the two lower realms, Preta and Naraka, are hellish, and the two higher realms, Deva and Asura, are heavenly, all six are considered to be realms of suffering, as they perpetuate Saṃsāra, the cycle of reincarnation; the only way to break this cycle and ascend to a higher state of existence is to attain enlightenment.\nThe Outer Path, derived from the Sanskrit term Tīrthika, refers to any doctrine that \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the Naidō (内道, literally meaning: Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical.\n\nTrivia[]\nDespite neither possessing the Rinnegan at the time, Madara Uchiha taught Obito to use the Six Paths Technique, alongside Uchiha kinjutsu and Yin–Yang Release techniques, shortly prior to his death. He then created a black rod out of his will and told Obito to use it when he performed the Six Paths Technique.[1]\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble, a technique called \"Six Paths Technique\" is used by Nagato's Six Paths of Pain. In this variant, Nagato generates a moderately sized sphere of debris overhead, then thrusts his arms downward, sending it crashing into the ground like a meteor. An enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called \"Six Paths Technique: Collapse\" (六道の術・崩壊, Rikudō no Jutsu: Hōkai) can also be performed.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Naruto chapter 606, pages 15-16\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 449, pages 1-2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 544, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 429, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 438, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 551, page 10"}
{"jutsu_name":"Six Paths Senjutsu","jutsu_type":"Senjutsu","jutsu_description":"Six Paths Senjutsu is a special form of senjutsu used by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki — the Sage of Six Paths — as well as his younger brother, Hamura.[2] Hagoromo is able to grant Six Paths Senjutsu to others, as he did with his son, Asura, and later with his son's reincarnate, Naruto Uzumaki. It can also be obtained by becoming the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, as taking in the power of the nine tailed beasts is the same as obtaining the power of the Sage of Six Paths himself.[3]\n\nOverview[]\nSix Paths Senjutsu is suggested to have a connection with the pattern that appears on the user's back when it is used, consisting of a Rinnegan-like marking above nine magatama, which resembles the pattern on the back of Hagoromo's robe.[1] The pattern that appeared on Obito Uchiha's back differed slightly from that of other known users, with the Rinnegan-like marking itself being shaped into a magatama.[4]\nAs a form of senjutsu, this ability grants similar benefits to Sage Mode, though the user's sensing capabilities are increased to a far greater extent, to the point where they can even sense shadows in the invisible world of Limbo.[5] They also gain a complete comprehension of chakra, including the ability to use all five basic nature transformations and make perfect use of Yin–Yang Release,[6] as well as an almost unconscious mastery of the floating ability used by the Sage of Six Paths.[7] When one awakens Six Paths Senjutsu, they also obtain a number of Truth-Seeking Balls.[8]\n\n     Obito's unique pattern.  \nAs the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, Obito and Madara Uchiha displayed several other unique abilities, though it is unknown if these apply to Six Paths Senjutsu users in general. The two were entirely immune to the effects of ninjutsu, only being vulnerable to senjutsu and taijutsu,[9] though techniques utilising Six Paths Power could also damage them.[10] They also possessed an extraordinary healing factor, capable of fully recovering from attacks that destroyed large portions of their bodies within seconds,[11] with Madara even claiming to be immortal.[12] Though taijutsu is viable, the sheer durability of Six Paths users means only techniques of the highest level have noticeable effect; Madara was merely pushed back by Daytime Tiger without harm.[13] Obito was capable of producing chakra arms from the protrusions on his back, which were powerful enough to tear through the Four Red Yang Formation with ease.[14] Despite not previously possessing the kekkei genkai, Madara was able to use a Storm Release technique,[15] which he accomplished due to having Six Paths Power.[16]\nNaruto is able to make use of Six Paths Senjutsu while in his Six Paths Sage Mode, a form which he received from Hagoromo.[7] When Naruto used this mode in conjunction with his chakra cloak during the Fourth Shinobi World War, he wore a unique shroud with the pattern associated with Six Paths Senjutsu on its back.[1] According to Sasuke Uchiha, the Truth-Seeking Balls Naruto used in this form utilised what he called \"Six Paths Sage Chakra\" (六道の仙人チャクラ, Rikudō no Sennin Chakura), which allowed them to damage Madara's shadow.[17]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn a single panel in chapter 656, the back of Hagoromo's robe is depicted with the same pattern found on Obito's back, rather than the usual pattern.[18]\nIn Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu, the cloaks worn by Hagoromo, Hamura, Madara (as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki) and Naruto (in Six Paths Sage Mode) are known as Six Paths Haori (六道羽織, Rikudō Haori).\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Naruto chapter 673, page 16\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 268\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 309\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 638, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674, pages 5-7\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 226\n\n↑ 7.0 7.1 Jin no Sho, page 310\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 249\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 667, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674, pages 11-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 672, pages 14-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 673, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 667, pages 12-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 636, pages 10-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674, page 4\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 321\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 656, page 9"}

Directly after obtaining Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki's power, Naruto's eyes are yellow[3] and later orange with the various chakra modes he uses after the war, just like his previous ones before meeting Hagoromo.[4] This mode increases the user's physical parameters well above that of Sage Mode and the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode,[1] as Naruto was able to kick away Truth-Seeking Balls before entering the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode with this power.[2] As a heightened state of Sage Mode, Naruto's jutsu are augmented with larger amounts of natural energy to make them stronger. With the power he received from Hagoromo, Naruto gains a masterful grasp of chakra, control over all things in nature, and the ability to comprehend all universal things.[1] His sensing ability also rises to the point where he can sense and thus react to the invisible shadows in the world of Limbo.[5]\nWhen Naruto uses his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in conjunction with his Six Paths Sage Mode, he can push his abilities even further, such as being able to levitate,[1][6] becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya Ōtsutsuki off guard and slice off her right arm,[7] even being durable enough to take a Chidori unharmed.[8]\n\nTrivia[]\n    Naruto's eyes in the original colourised chapters.  \nIt's unclear what this form's name signifies, and consequentially what the best translation is. \"Six Paths Sage Mode\" suggests it is a version of Sage Mode augmented with the Six Paths. \"Sage of Six Paths Mode\" would suggest it is named after Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, better known as the Sage of Six Paths. The original Japanese supports both translations, and in fact could intend for both meanings to be true.\nIn Shikamaru Hiden, it is suggested that having the chakra of all nine tailed beasts is also a requirement to obtain this mode.\nIn the colourised versions of chapters 676 and 678 included in digital editions of Weekly Shōnen Jump, Naruto's eyes in this mode were depicted with orange irides, much like his previous transformations. Later illustrations coloured by Masashi Kishimoto instead depict Naruto with yellow irides. The colouration was corrected in subsequent chapters and the Naruto: Colour Edition release of volume 71.\nIn VIZ Shonen Jump, Naruto's Six Paths Sage Mode was attributed to the Six Paths Yang Power. However, this is not mentioned in the manga or the databooks.\nIn Boruto: Naruto Next Generations chapter 52, Naruto asked about the difference between \"Baryon Mode\" and \"Kurama Mode and Sage of Six Paths Mode\" to Kurama. It is suggested that he was using the latter forms when he fought Isshiki Ōtsutsuki.\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Jin no Sho, page 310\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 672, page 17\n\n↑ Volume 70 cover\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto the Movie\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674, pages 6-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 680, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 687, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 695, page 5"}

Some shinobi also opt to use a cover such as mist or even frost to rob their opponents of their field of vision and then attack them.\n\nTrivia[]\nAlthough the name of this technique is written in kanji (無音殺人術), it's pronounced in English (\"silent killing\" (サイレント キリング)). The Japanese pronunciation of the kanji would be Muon Satsujin Jutsu, which would literally translate to \"soundless murder technique\".\nAccording to Kakashi, this technique allows the user to kill their opponent so quickly, that they die before realising it.[1]\nThe Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist are shown to be masters of this technique, and were even good enough to track and kill opponents through sound alone.[2][3]\nIn the anime, Mizuki attained the Silent Killing technique when he spent a year in the Konoha Strict Correctional Facility, where his eyes became attuned to the dark and damp environment.

{"jutsu_name":"Shrine Seal","jutsu_type":"Fūinjutsu, Hiden","jutsu_description":"This seal is in the Land of Swamps, and contains the body of the evil spirit Mōryō.\n\nOverview[]\nThe technique is composed of several stages. The first three seals will light the seal up, allow the user to levitate, and create a barrier. The barrier will repel things from the outside, although Mōryō managed to enter at the cost of the life of his host, Yomi. Also, the spheres inside the circle will begin to revolve around the circle.\nThe next nine seals will cause the gate-like seal leading to Mōryō's body to rise above the ground. This gate seems to be laid on its back.\nThe final six seals will release the seal on Mōryō's body, and it becomes accesible (to Mōryō). After reclaiming his body, Mōryō managed to break the barrier around the seal, as he mentions Yomi did not have the ability to do so.\nThe true effect of the sealing is that the user and the target being sealed will merge into one being. So that neither parties can utilise their chakra, the two minds are combined into one. Then one must absorb the other, as Mōryō did with Miroku (this gave to the rise of Mōryō in the first place, who was born from the darkness inside the hearts of people), and neither the user nor target can leave the shrine until this happens. Mōryō could not do the same with Shion due to the bell which contained the stone where Miroku sealed all of her powers into. Sacrifice is not really necessary, as the movie suggests that Miroku used this technique twice to seal Mōryō's body on opposite regions. Once completed, the tomb will store the victim for eternity.\nShion, however, knew nothing about this, instead believing the sealing technique will simply seal the demon away.\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique uses a brand of hand seals that are completely different from the standard twelve.\nDespite its name, this technique can be used away from shrines.\nAt the beginning of Naruto Shippūden the Movie, deep in the Land of Demons, Yomi used a similar technique by calling out the names of the nine hand seals used in the second stage of this technique, \"Min → Shin → Gan → Reppyo → Shōzen → Mika → Dan → Raku → Shō\", to shatter the seal on the door that locked Mōryō's soul."}

{"jutsu_name":"Shinra Tensei","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu","jutsu_description":"Shinra Tensei is a technique used through the Deva Path of the Rinnegan, said to be its pinnacle ability.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Influence\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nShinra Tensei can only be used by those who can manipulate the five basic nature transformations.[1] The user creates a \"repulsive force\" (斥力, sekiryoku), which is generally used to push away everything in the vicinity.[2] Users can narrow the repulsion's direction, only pushing away things on certain sides so that nearby allies will be unaffected.[3] This repulsive force is most commonly created around the user as a defence, repelling nearby opponents or incoming ninjutsu;[4] it can also be used to disperse ninjutsu that have already struck the user, such as Amaterasu.[5] Alternatively, the repulsive force can be created away from the user, destroying whatever is at the designated location.[6]\nShinra Tensei's strength and area of effect are determined by how much chakra is used. In its typical usage, it repels only within a few feet's distance and has enough force to destroy earthen constructs.[2] Nagato, after cutting off control of his other Six Paths of Pain and channelling all his chakra to the Deva Path, performs a Shinra Tensei that is large enough and powerful enough to reduce Konohagakure to a deep crater; doing this shortens his life[6] and afterwards dulls the responsiveness of his Six Paths of Pain.[7] At its standard strength, opponents can resist Shinra Tensei by securing themselves to the ground: coating their feet with chakra to increase traction,[8] digging in deeply enough to counter repulsion,[9] or grouping together to minimise the repulsive force's influence.[10] Shinra Tensei also exerts a recoil on the user. If the opponent can withstand the repulsive force and force the user to use enough force, they can turn Shinra Tensei against the user.[9]\nAfter Shinra Tensei is performed, there is a brief cooldown period during which it and other Deva Path abilities cannot be used. At a minimum, this cooldown is five seconds. During large-scale uses, such as the one that destroyed Konoha, the cooldown takes several minutes.[11]\n\nInfluence[]\nThe names of Shinra Tensei and its companion ability, Banshō Ten'in, are derived from Shinra Banshō (神羅万象, literally meaning: Everything Covered by God), a Japanese four-character idiom and homophone variant of Shinra Banshō (森羅万象, literally meaning: All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things), a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean \"All of Nature\" or \"All of Creation\".\n\nTrivia[]\n     The Shinra Tensei orb.  \nIn the anime, Shinra Tensei is sometimes depicted as an orb of varying colours which surrounds the Deva Path.\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble, an enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called \"Shinra Tensei: Seiatsu\" (神羅天征・征圧, literally meaning: Heavenly Subjugation of the Omnipresent God: Subjugating Pressure) can be performed.\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Sasuke can use Shinra Tensei while he is in his Complete Body — Susanoo form.\nIn the manga, Kaguya attacks Naruto and his clones with a repulsive force by extending her hand, but the name of the jutsu used is not mentioned.[12] In the Jump Force game, where the ability is seen again, it is confirmed to be Shinra Tensei.\nIn the anime, Momoshiki repels a burst of Fūma Shuriken through a jutsu with repulsive capabilities, but does not mention its name. Even so, the jutsu in question has the same characteristics as Shinra Tensei, is used through the Rinnegan and Momoshiki has demonstrated that he meets the necessary requirements (being able to manipulate the five basic nature transformations).[13]\nSee Also[]\nBanshō Ten'in\nChibaku Tensei\nRepulsion Technique\nTengai Shinsei\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Jin no Sho, page 260\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 420, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 447, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 421, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 550, page 14\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 429, page 10-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 430, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 429, page 1\n\n↑ 9.0 9.1 Naruto chapter 438, pages 5-6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 443, pages 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 434, page 9-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 685, page 9\n\n↑ Boruto episode 65"}

{"jutsu_name":"Shield of Sand","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Shield of Sand is the first part of Gaara's \"Absolute Defence\", his Armour of Sand being the second.\n\nOverview[]\nWhen Gaara was a child, his uncle, Yashamaru, told him that the Shield of Sand was the product of his mother, Karura. Karura's love for Gaara was so great that, in death, her spirit possessed the sands and used them to protect him.[2] Later that same day, Yashamaru, under orders of the Fourth Kazekage, tried to assassinate Gaara. After his attack failed, Yashamaru told Gaara that he lied earlier: Karura did not love Gaara; she hated him.[3] The Shield of Sand, said Yashamaru, was a result of Shukaku (sealed within Gaara) using the sand to keep Gaara, and thus itself, safe.[4] It isn't until many years later that the Fourth Kazekage confesses to Gaara that he ordered Yashamaru to lie: Karura truly did love Gaara and the Shield of Sand truly is her doing.[5]\nThe Shield of Sand reacts to any attack against Gaara, even those Gaara himself is not aware of. When he's about to be physically harmed in any way, the Shield of Sand moves between him and the threat in order to block it. Though most often used in shielding Gaara from enemies, the sand also protects him from self-inflicted injury.[2] The Shield of Sand is automatic, requiring nothing from Gaara to use and thus meaning it can operate indefinitely.[6] Because the shield is formed from sand that's been seeped in Gaara's chakra, it has a very fast response time, too fast for most enemies to overcome.[7] Some, such as Rock Lee and Sasuke Uchiha, are fast enough to outpace the sand, striking Gaara before it's able to shield him; it is against opponents such as these that he relies on his Armour of Sand for defence.[8][9] The combination of the armour and shield is an effective one, enabling Gaara to go years without the slightest injury.[10]\nThe Shield of Sand can protect Gaara against a great variety of threats, at different times defending him from kunai,[2] exploding tags,[3] Senbon Shower,[11] taijutsu,[10] Shikotsumyaku,[12] Explosive Clay,[7] and Amaterasu,[13] to name only a few. The sand itself is very good at absorbing the force from attacks, and so it is rarely even misshapen from the impact. On those infrequent occasions when attacks do push against the shield, it places enough of a buffer between it and Gaara to stop the blow before it reaches him.[12] Only incredibly fast, piercing attacks, notably the Chidori, have been shown to actually break through the Shield of Sand and injure Gaara.[14]\n\n    Karura manifesting as the shield.  \nEven though the Shield of Sand ordinarily acts independently of Gaara, he is able to exert some control over it if he chooses. He can fully surround himself with the shield, eliminating the chance of it being bypassed through sheer speed. While he does this, he relies on his Third Eye to see what's going on outside,[15] and then forms spikes from the shield to keep approaching enemies away. In Part I, Gaara usually enters this sphere of sand while preparing to enter Tailed Beast Mode.[14] In Gaara Hiden, Gaara uses his Magnet Release to mix \"sparkling metal particles\" into the Shield of Sand, fortifying it against attacks that would otherwise penetrate it. Even Karura's will sometimes influences the Shield of Sand, shaping it into her likeness as it protects Gaara to remind him of her.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe Fourth Kazekage believes it is because of the Shield of Sand that Gaara was able to succeed him as Fifth Kazekage.[5]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Rin no Sho, page 202\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Naruto chapter 130\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 131\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 97\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 Naruto chapter 548\n\n↑ Gaara Hiden\n\n↑ 7.0 7.1 Naruto chapter 249\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 82\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 111\n\n↑ 10.0 10.1 Naruto chapter 82\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 58\n\n↑ 12.0 12.1 Naruto chapter 213\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 464, page 12\n\n↑ 14.0 14.1 Naruto chapter 113\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 112"}

This causes the sacrifice to become the individual's identical copy, complete with perfect imitations of the original's kekkei genkai (such as the Sharingan) and unique weapons (such as Samehada). The original controls their copy remotely, thus making the copy's movements and knowledge indistinguishable as well. However, the copy is limited by how much of the original's chakra they are given, so particularly chakra-taxing jutsu cannot be used. Once the chakra from the original runs out, the sacrifice reverts to their own appearance and they die.[1]\nPain uses the Shapeshifting Technique to make Yūra into a copy of Itachi Uchiha and Mukade into a copy of Kisame Hoshigaki. The copies are given 30% of their original's chakra and are used to delay Team Kakashi and Team Guy.[2] Despite the copies supposedly being exactly the same as their original, Kakashi Hatake notices something different about the copy of Itachi, though he doesn't realise why until after the Shapeshifting Technique has ended.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Sha no Sho, page 268\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 255, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 260, page 15"}

If the user falls victim to a genjutsu, they can use their shadow to break their own finger, freeing themselves from the genjutsu's influence.[6] In The Last: Naruto the Movie, Shikamaru Nara uses the Shadow–Neck Binding to control the Ōtsutsuki clan's puppet, forcing them to fight among themselves.[7]\n\nTrivia[]\nIts full name is \"Leaf Secret: Shadow–Neck Binding Technique\" (木ノ葉秘伝・影首縛りの術, Konoha Hiden: Kage–Kubishibari no Jutsu, literally meaning: Tree Leaf Secret: Shadow–Neck Binding Technique).[8]\nIn the anime, it was shown that this technique can be manipulated in a similar manner to the Shadow Sewing Technique.[9]\nThe technique appears in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm as Shikamaru's ultimate technique.

The user changes the shape of their shadow into several sharp tendril-like needles and controls each separately. They can then attack the same or several targets simultaneously and at the same time snatch away their ability to move by sewing them stuck with the shadow threads. Because it is a physical attack, it is impossible to capture someone without harming them, but on the other hand, since the speed of invocation and the time of duration are excellent, it can be used when urgent restraint is required.\nThis technique is usually used to go through the target and capture them, but depending on the opponent, it can also be used as an attack to bring them down. This special characteristic finds its greatest effect when used as logistical support. After this technique hits someone, it can then be directly transformed back into the Shadow Imitation Technique; conversely, after immobilising the target(s) with the latter technique, a proficient user can then also transition so into the Shadow Sewing Technique to thereby subsequently inflict harm to the captured party.\n\nTrivia[]\nThis ninjutsu takes its name from the \"Kagenui\", a technique from ninja legends that immobilises a target by pinning their shadow with a kunai.[2]\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5, Shikamaru throws several explosive tags up in the air and uses this technique to pin them on his opponent.\nIn Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire, Shikamaru uses the special seal used in the Multi-Size Technique instead of the Bird seal, as the ring and little fingers were raised in the manga[3], but the index finger is raised instead of the ring finger in the movie.

{"jutsu_name":"Shadow Imitation Technique","jutsu_type":"Hiden, Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Shadow Imitation Technique is the signature technique of the Nara clan.\n\nOverview[]\nThe user manipulates their shadow across a surface to merge it with a target or targets' shadow. The user can stretch their shadow however they wish in order to accomplish this goal, but they are limited by their shadow's surface area; if a target can move far enough away from the Shadow Imitation's user, they are theoretically safe from it. But there are ways around this: the user's shadow can freely move within other shadows, extending its range;[2] Shikamaru Nara frequently uses flash bombs, either to briefly extend his own shadow or to extend his targets'.[3] Shikamaru Hiden clarifies that a user must have a shadow to manipulate, and so the Shadow Imitation cannot be used in utter darkness.\nOnce a user merges their shadow with a target's, the target cannot move on their own other than to talk. The only movements they are able to make are those that the user makes: if the user walks forward, the target walks forward; if the user raises their right hand, the target raises their right hand.[4] Nara tend to wear their shuriken holsters in atypical locations so that, when they reach for and throw shuriken, their targets will reach for and throw nothing.[5] Although most often used against opponents, the Shadow Imitation Technique can be used to save allies, freezing them in physically impossible positions so that they won't trigger booby traps[6] or causing them to cling to sheer surfaces with no means of support.[7] At times, the Shadow Imitation's mimicry is two-way, as if a third-party forces the target to make a move, the user will be forced to make the same move.[8]\nKeeping a target restrained requires a great deal of chakra, making it difficult to maintain the Shadow Imitation for long periods of time; in Part II, Shikamaru can only maintain it for five minute intervals.[9] With repeated use or against multiple targets, the duration of the binding becomes shorter.[10] If a target is strong enough or if the user is weakened enough, targets can resist and even overpower the Shadow Imitation's control. When that happens, Nara will inevitably use one of their other techniques, such as the Shadow–Neck Binding Technique or Shadow Sewing Technique.[11][12]\nThe Shadow Imitation Technique was previously known as the \"Leaf Secret: Shadow Bind Technique\" (木ノ葉秘伝・影縛りの術, Konoha Hiden: Kageshibari no Jutsu, literally meaning: Tree Leaf Secret: Shadow Bind Technique), which was only capable of restricting targets' movements.[13] The imitation aspect was apparently not added until after Orochimaru defected from Konohagakure, as his Otogakure invaders did not know about it prior to the Konoha Crush.[14] Shikaku Nara still uses the old name sometimes.[13] Young Nara are initially only taught the Shadow Bind, with the Shadow Imitation not being learned until later; in the anime, being able to use the Shadow Imitation is considered a rite of passage within the Nara clan.[15]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe Shadow Imitation Technique was originally created as a way to capture deer for their antlers.[1]\nA distinct sound can often be heard as indication of the technique successfully binding the user's shadow to the target's own.\nOn occasion, Shikamaru will say the name of the technique followed by \"complete\", to signify that he was successful in capturing his opponent.\nIn the novelisation of Boruto: Naruto the Movie, it is the Shadow Bind Technique - not the Shadow Imitation - that is usable through the Shinobi Gauntlet.\nIn the anime, Akita Inuzuka could perform this technique through the Shinobi Gauntlet.[16]\nIn the English dub of the anime, Sakon states that he mastered this technique.[17]\nIn the anime, Inojin Yamanaka tricked Metal Lee into believing that his ink snakes were this technique.[18]\nIn the Naruto: Clash of Ninja series, Kakashi can perform this technique by copying it with his Sharingan.\nIn Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2, using this technique on multiple opponents at once gives it the name \"Eight Way Shadow Imitation Technique\".\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Rin no Sho, page 171\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 107, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 207, pages 17-18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 108, pages 16-19\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 119, pages 2-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 185, page 16\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto the Movie\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 96, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 336, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 337, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 208, pages 13-14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 325, pages 9-10\n\n↑ 13.0 13.1 Naruto chapter 137, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 119, page 1\n\n↑ Boruto episode 97\n\n↑ Boruto episode 183\n\n↑ Naruto episode 112\n\n↑ Boruto episode 3"}

{"jutsu_name":"Shadow Clone Technique","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques","jutsu_description":"This article is about the jutsu. For the chapter, see Shadow Clone Technique.\n\n\n\n\nThe Shadow Clone Technique is a clone technique created by Tobirama Senju.[3]\n\nOverview[]\nThis jutsu allows the user to create one or more copies of themselves. The user's chakra is evenly divided between themselves and their clones: creating one clone will give it half the user's chakra, creating two clones will give each a third of the user's chakra, and so on. Depending on how much chakra the user has and how many clones they make, this rapid depletion of their reserves can be dangerous. Because of this, usually only those of at least jōnin-level can safely use the standard Shadow Clone Technique.[4] The Multiple Shadow Clone Technique – which creates hundreds of clones to the standard version's dozens – is unsafe to the point of being forbidden. Naruto Uzumaki is an exception to this rule; because he has access to the chakra of the Nine-Tails, he can create hundreds of clones without worry.[5]\n\n    Shadow clones' identical chakra pathway systems, seen with a Byakugan.  \nUnlike the basic Clone Technique, shadow clones are physically real. They possess the same clothing, damage, and transformations as the user at the time of their creation. Most tools and weaponry are copied when the shadow clones are created,[6] but certain chakra constructs[7] and complicated technology won't be duplicated.[8] Because they are visually identical and possess the same chakra as the user, shadow clones are indistinguishable from their original, not even by dōjutsu;[4][9][10] Madara Uchiha can identify shadow clones using his Rinnegan.[11]\nOnce created, shadow clones can serve a number of purposes. They can be used as decoys, either by keeping opponents preoccupied or, because they can't be told apart, concealing the original's identity.[12] If enough shadow clones are created, they can simply overwhelm an opponent, pinning them down or attacking from multiple directions.[6] Shadow clones can also be used simply to assist the user, joining the user for tactics they can't do alone[13] or being sent to carry out tasks while the user is busy. Shadow clones possess all the same memories as the user, and so will react to unforeseen obstacles just as the user would in the same circumstances. Because they have their own chakra, shadow clones can perform other jutsu, including making more shadow clones.[14]\nShadow clones usually disperse once they are struck hard enough, but they have been shown capable of enduring injuries for a time.[15] When a clone's task is completed, it can disperse itself or be dispersed by its user. Once dispersed, the clone's experiences and remaining chakra are transferred back to the user.[16] The shared experiences make shadow clones useful for intelligence gathering: a shadow clone can be sent into hostile territory, gather information without endangering the user, and disperse when finished, thus transferring what they've learned.[17] Alternatively, shadow clones can recon an area, dispersing when they've found what they're looking for in order to let the user know the target's location.[18]\n\n     Naruto using shadow clones to accelerate his nature transformation training.  \nKakashi Hatake discovered that shadow clones can also accelerate training periods. For example, by training alongside one shadow clone for one hour, the user will have two hours' worth of training experience once the shadow clone disperses. By using hundreds of clones, training that would usually take weeks or months can be completed within a few hours.[19] But because of how much chakra it takes to create just one shadow clone, and because the training itself will likely be arduous even without shadow clones, only Naruto can train in this way.[20] Naruto is indeed able to make effective use of this shortcut, but the combined experiences come with combined mental fatigue, requiring that he take regular breaks.[21]\nAlthough they are separate, shadow clones maintain small links between themselves and their original, intended to allow the user to reestablish control when needed. Users can exploit this link to network their clones, causing changes in their own chakra to extend to all the others.[3] In certain cases, this link can work against the user, such as when pain caused by the Nine-Tails' chakra was felt by all of Naruto's shadow clones.[22] While a user and/or their clones are performing tasks that require concentration, they're unable to have more than a few shadow clones active at a time.[23][24] In the novelisation of Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Naruto is consciously aware of what all his shadow clones around Konohagakure are doing. Although this allows him to have multiple conversations simultaneously, he has difficulty focusing on any one thing and the original Naruto becomes increasingly strained the longer the shadow clones are active; he drinks coffee and energy supplements in order to remain alert, but as soon as his concentration falters his shadow clones will all disperse.\n\nTrivia[]\nThe hand-seal for the Shadow Clone technique is similar to the one predominantly-used by the Monkey King, Sun Wukong (孫悟空), the leading main character in the late 70's Japanese live-action TV series, Saiyūki, based off-of the 16th century Chinese classical novel, Journey to the West, by Wu Cheng'en; this is appropriate, as Naruto was based-off-of this novel, and one of Sun Wukong's favoured tactics is to make replications of himself against enemies in battle, etc.\nMadara Uchiha used a shadow clone to fake his death.[25] The clone apparently lasted indefinitely since the ruse was never discovered.\nSasuke Uchiha views Naruto's extensive use of shadow clones as a symbolic way to avoid loneliness.[26]\nIn Naruto episode 129, Sasuke claims that the Sharingan can distinguish clones from the original. This contradicts the manga and other anime episodes.\nIn the anime, an ostrich named Condor appeared to use this technique, but in reality, it was just other ostriches.[27]\nIn Kakashi Hiden, while waiting for his new arm, Naruto creates shadow clones with a one-handed seal: a cross with his left hand's index and middle finger.\nIn the anime, the Genjutsu World's Hinata Hyūga can make shadow clones.[28]\nIn Naruto Shippūden episode 230, Naruto claims that his clones can dream.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Rin no Sho, page 170\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 167, page 11\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 644, page 15\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 100, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 1, pages 51-51\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 134, pages 4-6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 675, page 10\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 22\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 428, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 684, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 601, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 100, pages 15-18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 167, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 561, pages 15-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 697, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 433, pages 6-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 315, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 371, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 315, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 315, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 318, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 277, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 434, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 637, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 681, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 696, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 185\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 427"}

The web is so sensitive, that not even the slightest disturbance of the air goes unnoticed.\nMind's Eye of the Kagura — Exclusive to Karin.

When the rain is obstructed by a chakra belonging to someone not of the village, the existence of the intruder can be detected.\nSensing Hexagram Seal — A hexagram seal that allows the user, by transmitting waves, to sense targets in a large radius, akin to a radar.\nSensing Water Sphere — A sphere made out of water that lets the user monitor the surrounding area. Despite the usefulness, the sphere itself does not provide a complete form of detection, unless it is complemented with a barrier.\nNegative Emotions Sensing — Exclusive to Kurama and its jinchūriki.

With this technique, he is able to spread specialised sand across a wide terrain and detect anything that comes into contact with it, even if the target is invisible.\nTrivia[]\nThroughout the series, various characters have commented on the feel of chakra and similar comments regarding the ability to sense high, foul or potent levels of chakra a little, leading to the possibility that chakra sensing is merely a more refined version of this by either teaching or being simply born more \"sensitive\".[2][3][4][5]\nIn the anime, if a sensor struggles sensing beyond a limited range, they can expand it with a medium that employs their chakra to move around.

If a limb is severed, Victor can manipulate the limb or use his blood as tendrils to retrieve and immediately reattach it.[6] However, Victor's regeneration is not perfect as it is not capable of keeping up with inextinguishable Fire Release techniques.[7] Also, since Victor utilised a cursed seal to extend his life, prolonged usage of this technique would accelerate Victor's decline in health, as his over-usage led to his permanent loss of his right eye and leg and likewise leaves him extremely drained.[8]\nThe efficiency of this technique depends on the user's skills, as neither Victor nor Orochimaru required hand seals to perform it, but while Victor's usage was considered imperfect, Orochimaru's did not show such flaws. While Boro seems to be devoid of the flaws that Victor had, he was dependent on the core within his body to stabilise his regenerative powers, and he seemingly required to perform seals to purge the poison out of his body.\n\nTrivia[]\nSeveral sources referred to this technique as \"Self-Regeneration Technique\" (自己再生術, Jiko Saiseijutsu). Whether it is proper name or just a description of the type of technique is still unclear.[5][9]\nWhile this technique does not regenerate clothing, in the anime when Victor's head was bitten off by one of Orochimaru's snakes, his eyepatch was included on his new head.\nIn the anime, Boro claimed to his followers that he gained this power (regarding it as an \"indestructible body\") from a \"God\" he met.[10]\nSee Also[]\nBody Revival Technique\nCreation Rebirth\nMedical Water Release: Jellyfish\nUltra-Fast Regeneration Technique\nYin Healing Wound Destruction\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Boruto episode 206\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 40, pages 16-20\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 40, page 36\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 41, pages 28-36\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Boruto episode 175\n\n↑ Boruto episode 173\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 16, page 15\n\n↑ Boruto episode 179\n\n↑ TV Tokyo Boruto Official Website\n\n↑ Boruto episode 202"}

The seal must be placed at Rōen's weak point, on the back of its head. If successfully applied, Rōen's body gradually turns to smoke, which then travels to and is contained within the Kodon clan's shrine. Rōen will only remain imprisoned there for seven years, at which time the sealing must be performed anew. Kodon can release the seal before then if they choose.\nThe back of Rōen's head is covered with tentacles that shield the area and attack anyone who comes near, absorbing their chakra. Because of this, users require another person's help to distract Rōen while the seal is placed. Even with help, there's a good chance that the user will die trying to use the seal, or even immediately afterwards while Rōen's body still has form. If the seal isn't correctly applied, it will at least dull Rōen's movements, making it easier to try using the seal again.\nThe seal can also be used to confine Rōen within another's body; as with its typical use, the seal is placed at the back of the head. Reishi Kodon's body was not compatible with Rōen, but his infant brother, Kina Kodon, was. Doing this doesn't carry the seven year time limit, but it does link Rōen's chakra with Kina's: if ever the seal broke, Kina would die within ten minutes if a new seal couldn't be performed. As a curious side-effect, the seal also seemed to compel Kina to stay near the clan's shrine, preventing him and Reishi from relocating to a new home."}

For the episode of the same name, see Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals.\n\n\n\n\nThe Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals is a technique that was used by Pain and the other members of Akatsuki to forcibly seal a tailed beast [2] or to extract a still-living jinchūriki's tailed beast chakra into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. The technique took three full days to complete if nine of the Akatsuki members were present. Zetsu stated that if there are fewer people to perform the technique, it would take a while longer.[3]\nTo prepare for the technique, Pain would summon the Demonic Statue, after which each member would then stand on one of its fingertips, corresponding to their specific ring finger. When performed, this technique caused the bit to fall out of the mouth of the statue. Each of the Akatsuki members would then concentrate, causing the kanji of their rings to appear on the nail of the finger they were standing on. Nine dragon-like effigies then poured from the statue's mouth, surrounded the captured host, and painfully removed the tailed beast from them. In the case of an unsealed tailed beast, the same thing happened to the beast itself, and still took as much time as if it were sealed. After the process was complete, the beast was sealed within the statue, and one of the statue's nine eyes opened. The host would die due to the removal of their tailed beast. There is a numerical order, with the Nine-Tails needing be sealed last, or the statue would shatter.[4]\nHowever, with Nagato now dead, Tobi claimed that they would need a new pawn to synchronise with the Demonic Statue in order to seal the Eight-Tails and the Nine-Tails.[5] Though Nagato intended to use it for peace in the form of a weapon of mass destruction to keep governments in line, the technique was created for Madara Uchiha's Eye of the Moon Plan, as Obito was tasked with ensuring that the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and the tailed beasts would become the Ten-Tails once more.\n\nSee Also[]\nSummoning: Demonic Statue of the Outer Path\nTail Releasing Method\nTailed Beast Removal Technique\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, Page 294\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 329, page 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 419, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 353, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 450, page 9"}

Because of this, the clone can be reverted to sand at any time, most often when being attacked; as it's punched or kicked, Gaara can use the clone's sand to immediately capture the opponent's limbs. Alternatively, Gaara can use the clone as a decoy, drawing opponents to it and once they're close enough, manipulating the clone's sand against them.[1] Whereas other clones can only take so much damage before being destroyed, Gaara can reform the sand clone regardless of what happens to it.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Gaara shows the ability to make a sand clone that looks exactly like the Third Tsuchikage rather than himself.[3] In this case, the sand clone he makes exactly resembles who they're based on, not being sand-shaped lookalikes of previous depictions.\nGaara is also able to hide other materials within the sand clones to be used against opponents who attack them, such as Gold Dust against the Second Mizukage's Steaming Danger Tyranny.[4]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, Sasori used a sand clone as a replacement, although it dissolved after being hit.[5]\nSee Also[]\nIron Sand Clone\nMud Release: Mud Doll\nClone Trap\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Rin no Sho, page 204\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 111\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 556, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 557, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 8"}

{"jutsu_name":"Samurai Sabre Technique","jutsu_type":"Chakra Flow, Kenjutsu, Fighting Style","jutsu_description":"Unique to Samurai, this technique employs the concept of chakra flow in a similar manner to the Flying Swallow and Sword of Kusanagi: Chidori Katana techniques. Through the use of chakra flow, the user channels their chakra through their swords, extending both the reach and cutting ability of the blade, while allowing the user to fire crescents of chakra whenever the blade is swung. This released chakra is capable of great destruction, as shown from how these projectiles completely penetrated a considerable stone pillar, before continuing to damage the immediate surroundings.\nThe samurai have also shown the ability to use shape transformation during the implementation of this technique, sculpting their respective chakra blades into various rudimentary weapons that extend beyond the natural dimensions of their original swords; such as broadswords, spiked shafts and even axes. This capability allows them to rely on smaller swords reminiscent of wakizashi, while attaining greater reach, damage and the possibility of conducting surprise attacks as necessary.\nThis transformational quality also appears to extend to even the crescents of chakra launched from the blade, forming a diverse range of projectiles that includes giant buzzsaws and shafts of chakra, the shape of which are seemingly dependent on the structure of the previously formed weapon.[1]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, the group of samurai who initially demonstrate this technique are never depicted employing shape transformation unlike in the manga, instead retaining just a simple aura of chakra that surrounds their blades for the entirety of their short confrontation with Sasuke Uchiha.[2]\nSee Also[]\nFlying Swallow\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 460, pages 11-13\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 202"}

{"jutsu_name":"Sage Mode","jutsu_type":"Senjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the technique. For the chapter, see Sage Mode!!.\n\n\n\nSage Mode is an empowered state that can be entered by blending natural energy with one's chakra, creating senjutsu chakra. Sage Mode allows users to tap into the natural force of the world, opening up new techniques to them and allowing them to power up existing ones with the new senjutsu chakra.\n\nContents\n\n1 Training\n2 Attributes\n\n2.1 Advantages\n2.2 Disadvantages\n\n2.2.1 Bypassing the Disadvantages\n\n\n\n\n3 Forms\n\n3.1 Sage Mode\n\n3.1.1 Sage Transformation\n\n\n3.2 Tailed Beast Sage Mode\n3.3 Six Paths Sage Mode\n\n\n4 Techniques\n5 Trivia\n6 References\n\n\nTraining[]\n     Jiraiya training to master senjutsu.  \nSage Mode is known to be taught in two places: at Mount Myōboku by the toads and at Ryūchi Cave by the snakes. Users of Sage Mode must possess \"extreme chakra levels\" to invoke senjutsu.[2] It is also important that their bodies be strong enough to support the increased power. Orochimaru, who discovered the Ryūchi Cave and gained the ability to mould Senjutsu chakra, was not able to use Sage Transformation to enter Sage Mode for this reason.[3]\nIn order to enter Sage Mode, the gatherer must remain absolutely still in order to be one with nature and balance the natural energy with their own physical and spiritual energies.[4] If the user puts too little natural energy into using senjutsu, the technique will not work.[5] Conversely, if too much natural energy is taken in, their body will turn to stone forever; humans will also be transformed into whichever animal's school the senjutsu was learned from.[6]\nThe toads of Mount Myōboku have devised several tools to make learning Sage Mode easier. By applying a special oil, the applicant's body will start passively taking in natural energy.[7] This oil will evaporate if taken outside Mount Myōboku, thus rendering it useful only for learning purposes.[8] The toads also have a special staff that, when struck with, knocks all the natural energy out of the gatherer, thus reversing any transformations before they can become permanent and the user turns to stone.[9]\nAt Ryūchi Cave, one must be bitten by the White Snake Sage, who injects them with natural energy. According to legend, if one's body is strong enough to withstand said injection, it will accept the power without reservation. If not, the snake will devour the person whole.[10]\n\nAttributes[]\nAdvantages[]\nThe user's physical strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception, and durability are enhanced.\nThe user's ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu become more powerful.\nThe user can manipulate natural energy.\nThose who have mastered the Sage Techniques of Mount Myōboku have shown the ability to turn the natural energy around them into an extension of their body to increase the reach of their attacks.\nThose who have mastered the Sage Techniques of the Ryūchi Cave have shown the ability to use natural energy to breathe life into inorganic substances and control them.\nThe user can sense chakra around them and can sense attacks without the need to see them.\nWhen facing an opponent that can drain chakra, this can prove to be fatal to the opponent if they absorbed too much chakra and will be turned to stone if they haven't had training with Sage Mode in the past. Furthermore, the user of Sage Mode can hold still to absorb more natural energy for the opponent to absorb and turn their own chakra absorption against them.\nDisadvantages[]\nIn order to gather enough natural energy to initiate the transformation into Sage Mode, the user must remain perfectly still, leaving them vulnerable. Users have at times been shown entering Sage Mode without this preparation.[11][12]\nBecause the user needs to move during combat, the senjutsu chakra cannot be replenished, which means the user can't stay within this state for extended periods of time. Naruto states it is possible to lengthen the time limit.[13]\nBypassing the Disadvantages[]\nThese weaknesses, however, can be compensated for through various methods and techniques such as:\n\nThe Sage Art: Amphibian Technique, where one or more toads fuse with the user's shoulders and gathers natural energy for them to use, splitting the stillness aspect of senjutsu chakra moulding from the user, allowing them to move in a fight.\nAnother option is to employ shadow clones. The clones can gather natural energy elsewhere and are dispelled when the energy is needed, thus transferring the gathered energy to the original. For Naruto, this limited the number of shadow clones that he can have active at a time to five, for as long as the clones are gathering natural energy, creating any more than that would disrupt the clones' focus.\nKabuto Yakushi assimilated the DNA of Jūgo to replicate his clan's ability to passively absorb natural energy, thus allowing him to continuously collect the energy even while moving, bypassing these particular weaknesses.\nIf the user continually practices the use of their Sage Mode, then the time needed to recharge their sage chakra can be drastically shortened.\nIf the user is also a jinchūriki that has achieved harmony with their tailed beast, they can drastically speed up their ability to gather natural energy in tailed beast mode to the point of only needing a few seconds to fully charge or recharge their sage chakra. Tailed beasts can also assist their jinchūriki in gathering natural energy with their own chakra reserves.\nForms[]\nSage Mode[]\nUsers that can properly balance their own chakra with natural energy will not experience any animalistic transformations to their body. The one exception is a dark pigmentation around their eyes and the eyes themselves, which usually differ based on where the user learned Sage Mode.\n\nJiraiya was not able to properly balance his own chakra with natural energy, and as a result his appearance took on a number of toad-like traits when using Sage Mode: his nose grew bigger and gained warts, his teeth turned sharp, he grew a goatee, and acquired toad-like eyes. Because of these traits, Jiraiya did not like to use Sage Mode as it \"displeased the ladies\". Some of the physical alterations, such as the toad posture and the webbed feet, were beneficial and improved his manoeuvrability, and he could consciously manifest the alterations in order to take advantage of them.\nNaruto Uzumaki has yellow irides and toad-like pupils, with orange pigmentation around his eyes.\nHashirama Senju had yellow irides, with black pigmentation around his eyes that extended to his ears, as well as an additional round marking on his forehead with a dot in its centre (red on the cover of Weekly Shōnen Jump 2014 Issue #9[14], and green in the video game series as well as in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations[15]).\nMinato Namikaze had yellow irides and toad-like pupils, with orange pigmentation around his eyes.\nKoji Kashin has toad-like irides, with dark pigmentation around his eyes.\nJiraiya's Sage Mode.Naruto's Sage Mode.Hashirama's Sage Mode.Minato's Sage Mode.Koji's Sage Mode.\nSage Transformation[]\nMain article: Sage Transformation\nSage Transformation (仙人化, Senninka) is a way of attaining Sage Mode,[16] using a bodily reaction exhibited by members of Jūgo's clan. By exposing their special body fluids to natural energy, they gain increased physical capabilities and the ability to perform various shape-shifting feats.\n\nJūgo's skin tone darkens and his sclerae turn black. He also gains a black stripe running from the middle of his forehead and down the bridge of his nose. He receives a massive boost in overall ability, but loses his mind to his murderous side, signified by a change in his voice.\nKabuto has yellow, snake-like irides and blackened sclerae, as well as purple pigmentation around his eyes that extends down to his shoulder blades. His snake-like characteristics progress further in Sage Mode with him growing four horns, leading him to state that he had metaphorically transcended from a \"snake\" to a \"dragon\".\nMitsuki gains a cyan[17] chakra shroud that forms into ethereal snakes around his body to aid in his attack range. A single horn juts from his forehead and he gains black markings (green in the anime) around his eyes.[18]\nJūgo's Sage Mode.Kabuto's Sage Mode.Mitsuki's Sage Mode.\nTailed Beast Sage Mode[]\n     Naruto's Tailed Beast Sage Mode.  \nAfter earning the Nine-Tails' cooperation, Naruto becomes able to combine Sage Mode with his Tailed Beast Mode. The red irides turn orange, and the slitted pupils characteristic of normal Nine-Tails transformations merge with the Sage Mode's eye pattern, creating a design reminiscent of a cross. While using the combined form, Naruto gains simultaneous access to both forms' advantages, such as augmenting Tailed Beast Balls with senjutsu chakra.[19] The combination of both forms allows for a greater power than either Tailed Beast Mode or Sage Mode individually, which allowed Naruto to hold his own against the likes of Obito Uchiha as the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki.[20] Two years after the War, Naruto's skill with this form had increased to the point where he could fly within it, and easily shatter Truth-Seeking Balls during his battle with Toneri Ōtsutsuki.[21]\n\n\nSix Paths Sage Mode[]\n     Naruto's Six Paths Sage Mode.  \nMain article: Six Paths Sage Mode\nSix Paths Sage Mode (六道仙人モード, Rikudō Sennin Mōdo) is a divine transformation gifted by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki to those who have an iron faith and the will to never give up.[22] It significantly enhances the user's powers and allows them to use a number of new techniques.\n\nTechniques[]\nList of senjutsu\nTrivia[]\nThe manifestation of animal-like traits is a reference to the Japanese folktale Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari, where Jiraiya, Tsunade, and Orochimaru came to study specific animal magic into their ninjutsu use.\nThe sage training method used by the Toads of Mt. Myōboku resembles the practices of Shugendō, a highly syncretic religion that originated in Heian Japan in which enlightenment is equated with attaining oneness with the kami. This perception of experiential \"awakening\" is obtained through the understanding of the relationship between humanity and nature, centred on an ascetic, mountain-dwelling practice. In some Japanese myths, supernatural creatures often appeared as Yamabushi (mountain hermits) of Shugendō, which the Toad Sages of Mt. Myōboku and White Sage Snake bear some resemblance.\nIn the anime, the term \"Honoured Sage Mode\" was only used by Jiraiya. This was corrected to \"Sage Mode\" in later uses, presumably to create a distinction between Jiraiya's use of the technique.\nDespite granting the user the ability to sense chakra, Jiraiya, Shima, and Fukasaku seemingly didn't display this ability during their fight against the Six Paths of Pain.\nIn Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison, the red coat Naruto wore during Pain's Assault appears when he enters Sage Mode and disappears when he turns back to normal.\nIn the anime, before life on Earth had chakra with which to infuse it, the use of natural energy was called Sage Power (仙力, senriki).[23]\nIn the anime, the snakes of Ryūchi Cave note that Boruto Uzumaki has the potential for senjutsu, having passed trials that proved his strength of body and could handle natural energy.[24]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Third Databook, page 279\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 412, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 579, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 409, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 410, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapters 409-410\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 410, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 417, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 410, page 17\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 136\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 535, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 665, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 468, page 16\n\n↑ Weekly Shōnen Jump 2014, Issue #9\n\n↑ Boruto episode 22\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 265\n\n↑ Artwork for the first Boruto volume\n\n↑ Naruto Gaiden: The Road Illuminated by the Full Moon\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 645, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 646-650\n\n↑ The Last: Naruto the Movie\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 310\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 462\n\n↑ Boruto episode 77"}

As the dragon tightly coils itself around the orb, it releases both blinding light and deafening sound by making the air oscillate. This alone greatly hinders those in the vicinity but, due to the intensity of the resulting vibrations, paralysing pain is also induced. Thus, the technique both briefly inhibits the opponent's senses, as well as techniques that require their active concentration.\nAccording to Kabuto, only he is capable of functioning normally whilst this technique is in effect, thanks to the properties of his Sage Mode and his adopted abilities. Due to his snake characteristics, Kabuto can close the cornea of his eyes to completely block the harmful light, whilst instead relying upon the enhanced perception of his other senses to compensate for his obstructed vision.

Thousands of hands originate from the statue's back in countless concentric rows, while its two main hands are clasped, as if in prayer. The statue can serve a variety of purposes in battle, from fighting on the user's behalf to defending and even using other techniques. The sheer size of this technique makes it almost impossible to attack the user.[2]\nIt can also detach its main self from its main arsenal to increase its mobility to adapt to a situation that requires more speed. With its immense strength, it can grab hold of a tailed beast with ease and hold it in place, leaving it unable to move. Hashirama can then use the Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands in conjunction with the Wood Human on the statue's head to suppress and remove any direct control over the tailed beast.[3]\n\nInfluence[]\nThis technique seems to be influenced by the Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokiteśvara, also known as \"Senju Kannon\" (千手観音, literally meaning: Thousand-Armed Kannon).\nOne prominent story tells of Kannon vowing never to rest until he had freed all beings from Saṃsāra. After strenuous effort, but struggling to comprehend the needs of so many who still had yet to be saved, his head splits into eleven pieces. The Buddha Amida, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear the cries of the suffering. Upon hearing and comprehending these cries, Kannon attempted to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces.

Because of their origin, their DNA is very similar to Hashirama's, as revealed by Shizune and Sakura Haruno's autopsy results.\n\nUsage[]\nThis ability has the advantage of healing most damage that the user sustains without the need for hand seals.

{"jutsu_name":"Redaku Reincarnation Ninjutsu","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Reincarnation Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"This reincarnation ninjutsu is one of the many subjects documented at the centuries-old Astronomy Research Institute, an archive of knowledge for the Land of Redaku. A few years prior to the events of Sasuke Retsuden, Zansūru, an archaeologist, deciphered enough of the relevant research to learn how to use this technique. However, because he was not a ninja, he recruited Jiji to perform it on his behalf. A few decades prior to this, Orochimaru visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon Tobirama Senju's Impure World Reincarnation.\n\nOverview[]\nThis technique is similar to the Impure World Reincarnation in many ways, to the point that Sasuke Uchiha initially believes they are the same. Zansūru insists that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant. Like the Impure World Reincarnation, this technique brings back souls of the dead using living sacrifices; Jiji exclusively reincarnates dinosaurs (more commonly called \"dragons\"), but also planned to reincarnate a human, Margo, until he found out that she wasn't actually dead. Jiji summons a dinosaur's soul using its fossilised remains and places its soul in the body of the live sacrifice: a chicken, one of the closest extant relatives of dinosaurs. Dust and ash encase the chicken's body, giving it the same size and appearance as the dinosaur had in life.\nThe dinosaur's reincarnated body retains all the physical skills it had when it was alive. In the novel, it also has the added advantage of being immortal; it can be damaged, but its body will repair itself indefinitely regardless of severity. Not all wounds heal at the same speed, with burns being observed to still linger after several days. Unlike the humans reincarnated with the Impure World Reincarnation, who don't seem fazed by injuries, the dinosaurs reincarnated with this technique still feel pain. Yet because they can't die, they must suffer through any injuries that would ordinarily kill them until their body is healed. This detail draws empathy from Sasuke, prompting him to avoid injuring the dinosaurs when possible: he believes Amaterasu could be used to \"kill\" the dinosaurs, burning them with undying flames and rendering them incapacitated, but decides not to try it so as not to subject them to the prolonged pain that would cause. However in the anime adaptation this jutsu lacks most of the immortality advantages. The reincarnated beings bleed and can be killed with a serious enough damage.\nHow the user controls the reincarnated is never made clear, only that there are no talismans placed in the skulls as is done with the Impure World Reincarnation. The user's control over those they reincarnate is great enough that it can't be overcome with standard genjutsu. Sasuke is able to somewhat erode the control over one dinosaur, Menō, by speaking to him kindly, refusing to harm him, and by offering to return him to the afterlife, something that Menō wants. This momentarily allows him to establish control over Menō with a genjutsu, which he then makes permanent by channelling his chakra into Menō's body to overwrite Jiji's control.\nHaving control of a reincarnated form grants certain advantages. Information gathered by the reincarnated can be instantly passed along to their controller, such as to help the controller locate somebody they're searching for. Conversely, the controller can pass some of their chakra to the reincarnated, enhancing their strength: Menō, a juvenile of his species, is able to overpower an adult of the same species because he has access to Sasuke's chakra. Control of one or more reincarnated subjects can be granted to non-users - as Jiji does to Zansūru - but these non-users cannot give commands that are too complicated. Furthermore, new commands will immediately override previous commands regardless of potential consequences; Zansūru at one point commands a flying dinosaur to let him ride it, but later gives the same dinosaur a new command unrelated to being ridden, causing Zansūru to fall off and die upon impact with the ground. If and when the non-user dies, any commands they gave are rescinded and the original user's most recent commands take effect again.\nTo release this technique, the user performs the same hand seals that are used to initiate it in the first place, thus freeing the souls (even those under the control of another) from their reincarnated bodies. The souls do not immediately return to the afterlife, instead lingering in their bodies for a few moments; this brief delay gives Sasuke and Menō a chance to exchange farewells. One dinosaur is even shown clinging to its reincarnated body, using the brief window of no longer being controlled to attack Jiji, vengeance for having brought it back to the living world. Once the souls do finally depart, their body disintegrates back into the dust and ash that they were made of."}

He then opens his right chest compartment to emit more than a hundred chakra strings, which reach into the scroll. From the scroll, more than a hundred puppets wearing red cloaks emerge.\nAs even the most elite of puppeteers cannot control more than ten puppets a time (one per finger), this technique is proof of Sasori's superiority with regard to the Puppet Technique. Also, normally a puppet's movement is dependent on the will of the user, and as such there will be a time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response. However, since these hundred puppets are directly connected to Sasori's core, there is no time lag between Sasori's will and the puppets' movements.\nSasori stated that he brought down an entire country (the Land of This in the anime) with this technique. Many of the puppets, however, were destroyed during Sasori's battle with Chiyo and Sakura Haruno, although they did manage to destroy some of Chiyo's White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets. While these one hundred puppets lacked teamwork, they apparently used sheer attrition and numbers to overwhelm their opponents.

The power and effects of the attack on the target depend upon how much planetary chakra the user gathers, and are therefore proportional to the amount of time spent accumulating it.[2]\nAs the user absorbs this planetary chakra it visibly coils around their limbs and torso, and can be passed into the bodies of others by simply touching them.[3] This can result in mild disorientation for those affected, making it more difficult to effectively move and attack.[4]\n\n    The jutsu at maximum output.  \nIn order to complete the technique the user strikes the enemy with their palm, typically aiming for their chest or stomach, and forcibly infuses the planetary chakra into their body. At maximum output, \"Uzuhiko\" is capable of killing the target with a single blow, erupting into a swirling vortex of chakra that forcefully blows away and tears apart their body, effectively disintegrating them.[5]\nAt lower output levels, it deals damage similar to a standard Rasengan, along with the planetary chakra rushing through the target's body continuously inflicting internal damage and leaving the enemy in a perpetual state of vertigo, destroying their sense of balance and diminishing their motor skills.[6] As these effects persist semi-permanently, ending only if the user rescinds \"Uzuhiko\" or the planet itself stops spinning,[7] it causes not only physical harm but immeasurable psychological damage,[6] making it an effective tool for interrogation and coercion.[8]\n\nTrivia[]\nBoruto finds this technique as an ironic counter against the Ōtsutsuki clan and its followers, as it is essentially the planet fighting back against those trying to kill it.\nBoruto refers to the planetary energy used for Uzuhiko as a \"planet's chakra\", but this is not the same as the \"natural energy\" used by ninja when they enter Sage Mode.[6]\nSee Also[]\nChidori Current\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 12, page 21\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 12, page 22\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 3, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 3, page 13\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 12, pages 27-29\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 6.2 Boruto Database: Rasengan Uzuhiko\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 3, pages 25-26\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 3, pages 27"}

{"jutsu_name":"Rasengan","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Rasengan is a jutsu that takes form as a spinning ball of chakra, invented by Minato Namikaze.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Improvement\n\n2.1 Senjutsu Influence\n2.2 Tailed Beast Influence\n\n\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nMinato came up with the idea for this technique after seeing a Tailed Beast Ball being used.[2] Because his lover, Kushina Uzumaki, was a jinchūriki, she would inevitably be deployed to fight opponents who would use Tailed Beast Balls against her. Minato therefore wanted to develop a technique that Kushina could use to match against those opponents, which also worked with her chakra volume as a jinchūriki. Minato struggled with the original concepts for the technique, as they were either too weak or too unstable for use. It was only from a conversation with Jiraiya that Minato thought of a way to make the technique usable. Because of Jiraiya's inspiration, Minato wanted to call the technique \"Halo Frozen Dessert Hair Whorl Jiraiya Twin Formula Sphere\" (光輪冷菓発起旋毛自来也双式ノ丸, Kōrin Reika Hakki Tsumuji Jiraiya Sōshiki no Gan), but both Jiraiya and Kushina felt it was too long and lame. Kushina suggested \"Rasengan\" instead, which Minato agreed was a better name.[3] Minato would continue refining the Rasengan, ultimately taking three years of development time to perfect it.[4]\nTo perform the Rasengan, users gather chakra in the palm of their hand, which they spin rapidly in multiple directions in order to contain the chakra into a spherical shape.[5] No hand seals are involved, in theory making it easy to learn and use,[4] nor does it require additional chakra to maintain once it's properly formed.[citation needed] The Rasengan grinds into whatever it comes into contact with, doing extensive damage until the spinning chakra dissipates;[5] Jiraiya describes it as more powerful than the Chidori,[6] an assessment that Sasuke Uchiha agrees with after comparing the two.[7] If users thrust the Rasengan into targets, they can be propelled away from the user until they eventually collide with some obstacle.[8] The Rasengan's various attributes have earned it recognition as the pinnacle of shape transformation.[9]\n\n    Naruto using a water balloon for the first step.  \nThe Rasengan requires a great deal of chakra control to perform, making it incredibly difficult to learn. For this reason, Jiraiya breaks up the process into three steps when he teaches it to Naruto Uzumaki.[5] Naruto subsequently uses these same three steps when he teaches it to Konohamaru Sarutobi,[10] who in turn later uses them when he teaches it to Boruto Uzumaki:[11]\n\nRotation - the user learns to spin their chakra in multiple directions at the same time. Users may be given a water balloon while they practice, to help them mark their progress by the churning water. The step is completed when users are able to burst the water balloon with their chakra.[12] In theory this should be done with one hand, but Naruto initially uses chakra from both of his hands to increase the agitation, thus saving time.[13] It can be useful to know in which direction one's chakra naturally spins, in order to avoid impeding oneself.[4]\nPower - the user increases the volume and density of chakra they output. To help in this regard, users may be given a rubber ball: there is no water inside to help them burst the exterior and the rubber shell is thicker than a balloon's. It's important that users are able to actually destroy the rubber ball, not merely rupture it,[13] as only by destroying the ball will users know that their chakra is sufficiently concentrated. This step can be painful for users, as they may not be accustomed to emitting so much chakra from their hands at once,[14] and in fact they may end up injuring themselves in the process of destroying the ball.[15]\nContainment - the user must combine the first two steps into a contained sphere. To help in this regard, users may be given a balloon to help them visualise the intended shape; if the balloon is popped or otherwise moves, mastery is not yet achieved. This is by far the most difficult of the three steps because of how refined the user's chakra control must be.[5] Naruto and Konohamaru end up using shadow clones as a shortcut, the clone's hands helping them keep the chakra contained.[16][10] Both do eventually learn to perform the Rasengan without the need for shadow clones, Naruto during the Fourth Shinobi World War,[17] Konohamaru by the time he begins leading Team 7.[18]\nOnce learned, the Rasengan appears largely identical from one user to the next. The only potential difference is its size: when Boruto first learns to use the Rasengan, it's noted to be quite small. With greater proficiency, the size of a user's Rasengan grows to be about the size of their hand.[11]\n\nImprovement[]\n     Multiple, bigger Rasengan.  \nBecause of how useful the Rasengan is once it's been learned, many users end up inventing variants or additional applications based upon it. Creating larger versions of the Rasengan is one of the more straightforward methods, as seen with its Big, Ultra-Big, and Super-Ultra-Big versions. Another option is to increase the number of Rasengan that the user creates: most users are limited to two (one in each hand), but Naruto also develops a practice of having his shadow clones perform their own Rasengan, giving him dozens of Rasengan to attack with simultaneously. In the anime, Boruto devises a way of compressing the Rasengan, thus increasing its penetrative strength.\nMinato created the Rasengan with the intention of combining it with his own nature, a task that proved too difficult for him to complete prior to his death. Kakashi Hatake also failed to combine the Rasengan with his own lightning-nature, causing him to invent the Chidori instead.[9] Naruto encounters similar struggles to combine the Rasengan with his wind-nature, which he describes as needing to look left and right at the same time.[19] He is eventually able to overcome this obstacle by using a shadow clone to provide the nature transformation while he and another shadow clone form the Rasengan.[20] This ultimately leads to the creation of the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken, which is most notable for its ability to be thrown.[21] Years later, Boruto unknowingly adds his own lightning-nature to his Rasengan, which causes it to turn invisible if thrown, potentially lowering an opponent's guard before it strikes them.[22]\n\nSenjutsu Influence[]\n     Naruto using Sage Technique: Rasengan.  \nWhen in Sage Mode, the user can use a senjutsu-enhanced version known as Sage Technique: Rasengan (仙術・螺旋丸, Senjutsu: Rasengan, English TV: Sage Art: Rasengan, literally meaning: Sage Technique: Spiralling Sphere).[23] It is fundamentally the same as the normal version, except stronger. For Naruto, it is while using Sage Mode that he is first able to throw the Wind Release: Rasenshuriken,[21] which previously would sporadically lose its shape if he didn't hold on to it.[24]\n\nTailed Beast Influence[]\n     Naruto in his one-tailed form, preparing the Rasengan.  \nNaruto, as a jinchūriki, can use the Nine-Tails' chakra to assist in using the Rasengan. While using a version 1 cloak in Part I, he makes a Rasengan without the aid of a shadow clone, using the cloak itself to contain it.[25] Due to the Nine-Tails' influence, this Rasengan is darker in colour and much stronger. Different video games have called it \"Demon Fox Rasengan\" (妖狐螺旋丸, Yōko Rasengan, literally meaning: Demon Fox Spiralling Sphere), \"Vermilion Rasengan\" (朱い螺旋丸, Shui Rasengan, literally meaning: Vermilion Spiralling Sphere), \"Nine-Tails Rasengan\" (九尾螺旋丸, Kyūbi Rasengan, literally meaning: Nine-Tails Spiralling Sphere), and \"Crimson/Blazing Rasengan\" (紅蓮螺旋丸, Guren Rasengan, literally meaning: Crimson Spiralling Sphere). After learning to use the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in Part II, Naruto uses chakra arms in place of a shadow clone to help him create the Rasengan.[2] Because he can manifest multiple chakra arms at once, this in turn means he can use multiple Rasengan simultaneously, such as for the Spiralling Strife Spheres.\nThe Nine-Tails is uncooperative when Naruto first starts using the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, preventing him from using the Tailed Beast Ball. He tries to create an alternative in the Tailed Beast Rasengan, but he's unable to do so. The Nine-Tails does eventually agree to work with him, allowing him to use Tailed Beast Ball and thus making the Tailed Beast Rasengan unnecessary. Naruto is later given access to the other tailed beasts' chakra, whose natures he can apply to the Rasengan and its variants, such as the Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan.\n\nTrivia[]\n     The Rasengan's colour in Naruto: Colour Edition.  \nThe colouring of the standard Rasengan varies throughout the manga. For example, it's yellow on the cover of volume 52, blue on the cover of volume 67, and orange on the cover of Weekly Shōnen Jump #35 (2005).\nThe anime is more consistent about depicting the Rasengan as blue, with the exception of The Last: Naruto the Movie, which depicts it as orange.\nWhile Minato intended to pass this technique on to Kushina,[26] it is unknown if he succeeded.\nIn the anime, if used underwater, the rotation force of the Rasengan is capable of creating a whirlpool.[27]\nThe anime shows Naruto being able to throw the Rasengan,[28] something that is later established to require special training.[21]\nKatasuke uses this technique through his Shinobi Gauntlet.\nIn Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3, Jiraiya spews fire onto his Rasengan, creating the Fire Release: Great Flame Rasengan.\nJump Super Stars is one of the few video games where Part I Naruto is able to access his non-clone-refined version of his Rasengan, dubbed as \"Rasengan: In Training\" (螺旋丸・修行中, Rasengan: Shugyōchū, literally meaning: Spiralling Sphere: In Training).\nLikewise also in both the first 2 Uzumaki Chronicles games, Naruto can perform a version of the Rasengan without a clone enhancing it (holding down the input in the second game does involve the clone and turns it into a \"True Rasengan/Spiralling Sphere\" with merely an increased damage multiplier and hitbox duration).\nThe video game Battle Stadium D.O.N. also curiously does not have a clone assist Naruto in the formation of the technique.\nThe Rasengan's appearance resembles Kūatsuken, a technique from the Ninku series.\nSee Also[]\nAmenomihashira\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Tō no Sho, pages 282-283\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 519\n\n↑ \"Naruto Gaiden: Whirlwind in the Vortex\"\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 Naruto chapter 151\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 Naruto chapter 155\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 143\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 176, pages 10-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 168\n\n↑ 9.0 9.1 Naruto chapter 321, pages 9-10\n\n↑ 10.0 10.1 Naruto chapter 428\n\n↑ 11.0 11.1 Boruto chapter 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 150\n\n↑ 13.0 13.1 Naruto chapter 152\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 153\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 154\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 167\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 642, page 13\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 329\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 330\n\n↑ 21.0 21.1 21.2 Naruto chapter 432\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 665\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 340\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 232, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Naruto Gaiden: Whirlwind in the Vortex, pages 25, 51\n\n↑ Naruto episode 104\n\n↑ Naruto episode 194"}

During this technique, the falling raindrops are closely linked to Pain's senses. When the rain is obstructed by a chakra belonging to someone not of the village, the existence of the intruder can be detected. The detection of the rain, however, is not specific as Pain can only know if someone has entered the vicinity of the rain but not where specifically they are. Upon knowing an intruder has entered the rain's vicinity, he needs someone who specialises in covering large areas to find the intruder's specific location. The rain will keep on falling until Pain uses the seal to cancel it. When Pain is away from Amegakure, he always uses this technique to keep a close eye on the village. He also made it rain every Sunday.\nAssuming that no one in the village knows about the sensory nature of this technique apart from Nagato and Konan, outsiders will think the rain is a natural occurrence and will not be aware they will be detected once the raindrops fall upon them.\n\nTrivia[]\nThe tiger is well-known for its ferocity and watchfulness.

{"jutsu_name":"Puppet Technique","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Bukijutsu, Fighting Style","jutsu_description":"The Puppet Technique is the core skill of a puppeteer's (傀儡使い, kugutsutsukai) fighting style, whereby they control a puppet.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Known Styles\n3 Trivia\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nThe modern version of the Puppet Technique used by shinobi was first created by Monzaemon Chikamatsu of Sunagakure.[2] Monzaemon originally intended the Puppet Technique for purely entertainment purposes, but by collaborating with shinobi he adapted the skill for combat.[citation needed] In the years following the technique's creation, Suna's shinobi became pioneers in the art of puppetry, with its Puppet Brigade being given the specific mandate of finding new ways to use and exploit puppets for battle.[3]\n\n    Chakra Threads.  \nPerforming the Puppet Technique involves emitting chakra threads (チャクラの糸­, Chakura no Ito) from a user's fingers to connect to a puppet, with the fingers' movements controlling the puppet's actions.[1] Less experienced users will connect all ten of their fingers to a single puppet, with each finger controlling a specific joint or mechanism. As a user becomes more experienced they require fewer threads to control a single puppet, until finally they can control a puppet using only one thread. With this growing mastery, users also become able to control multiple puppets at a time, ten being the normal limit (one per finger).[4] No matter how many threads are being used per puppet, the user's will plays a large role in a puppet's movements, thus creating an inevitable time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response.[5]\nControlling a puppet requires most of a puppeteer's attentions and maintaining the threads is a constant drain on their chakra.[1] Not only does this mean a puppeteer is vulnerable when they are controlling a puppet, it also tends to mean they cannot fight very well without one, as their combat style relies so heavily on them. As such, puppeteers try very hard to hide or at least keep their distance from opponents.[6]  In the event that an opponent gets too close, some puppeteers have devised countermeasures: certain puppets created by Sasori, such as Sanshōuo and Hiruko, are intended to be controlled from the inside, acting as shields for their puppeteers;[7] Chiyo replaced one of her arms with a Mechanical Light Shield Block, giving her a defensive option to use in emergencies;[8] Kankurō is in the habit of disguising puppets as himself, causing opponents that attack him to instead fall into his puppets' clutches.[9][10] It should also be noted that, while the Chakra Threads are difficult to notice, it is possible to cut them, effectively disabling the puppet in the process.[11] The threads can also be used to wrap around opponents in order to restrict their movements.[12]\nBecause puppeteers rely on their puppets for almost all aspects of combat, keeping the puppets safe is of paramount importance. At the simplest, this means not allowing the puppets to be destroyed or otherwise disabled.[13] More than that, it is also vital to keep how a puppet works secret from opponents. If an opponent knows what weapons or traps a puppet is outfitted with, the puppeteer will lose the advantage of surprise that so often gives them the upperhand.[14] If an opponent knows how a puppet is designed – which, unlike weapons and traps, cannot be greatly altered by the puppeteer – they can focus their attacks on the puppet's structural weaknesses.[15]\nIf a puppeteer does lose their puppet in battle (or if they merely opt not to use one), the chakra threads remain a versatile tool. The threads can be connected to opponents to impede their movements, such as by tripping them, or to take control of their body, using them as a puppet.[1] To prevent opponents from noticing that they're being manipulated, puppeteers will use a minimal amount of chakra to create the threads, rendering them invisible. If chakra threads are attached to weapons, such as kunai, this not only allows users to throw multiple weapons at a time, but also allows them an easy method of connecting their threads to distant targets.[16] Puppeteers can attach chakra threads to faraway targets even without this subterfuge, giving them a quick way to bring objects to their side.[17]\nCenturies before Monzaemon created his version of the Puppet Technique, the Ōtsutsuki clan used a different version that had fewer of the above drawbacks.[18] The Ōtsutsuki were able to control their puppets (or other people) remotely from seemingly any distance. The novelization of The Last: Naruto the Movie explains that this was achieved by placing orbs of chakra within the puppets' bodies, allowing the Ōtsutsuki to control their puppets through thought alone. Over time, these puppets became mostly autonomous, requiring no conscious effort to control and only needing the Tenseigan to power their movements. In Gaara Hiden, after Kankurō studies reports of the Ōtsutsuki's puppets, he achieves a similar effect by using imperceptibly thin chakra threads; although this doesn't make his puppets autonomous, it does significantly increase the range he can control them from.\n\nKnown Styles[]\nWhite Secret Technique (白秘技, Shirohigi) - practised by Monzaemon and Chiyo.\nRed Secret Technique (赤秘技, Akahigi) - practised by Sasori and Kankurō.\nBlack Secret Technique (黒秘技, Kurohigi) - practised by Kankurō and Shinki.\nTrivia[]\nSasori converted himself into a puppet in order to overcome many of the Puppet Technique's shortcomings: he can control one hundred puppets simultaneously, experiences no time lag between command and movement because his puppets are directly attached to his \"core\",[5] and close combat doesn't have any lasting impact on him since his body isn't flesh and blood.[19]\nIn Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower, Mukade could use this technique to control thousands of puppets at a very long range. He achieved this by connecting his chakra threads to pipes that distributed chakra across Rōran, expanding the number of threads and distance he could cover.\nIn some Naruto video games, Kankurō demonstrates greater versatility in hand-to-hand combat than puppeteers are said to possesses, as he mixes his puppet control with haymakers and other forms of taijutsu.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Rin no Sho, page 180\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 269\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 280, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 272, page 12\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Sha no Sho, page 223\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 126, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 265, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 269, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 70, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 213, pages 18-20\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 518\n\n↑ Naruto Shippūden Episode 182\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 126, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 106, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 251, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 266, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 272, page 9\n\n↑ Retsu no Sho\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 271, pages 5-8"}

However, a highly skilled user can control the target by force if the person is severely weakened or damaged, rendering them unable to resist.[2]\nIn Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage, Kankurō was able to combine this technique with his knowledge of the chakra pathway system to develop the ability to use the chakra threads to disrupt his victim's flow of chakra, thus hindering their ability to use techniques and causing them extreme pain.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn chapter 34,  Kankurō performed a similar manoeuvre to this to make Naruto trip.\nIn the anime, this technique is referred to as the Dance of Sakura (サクラの舞, Sakura no Mai, English TV: Ninja Art: Sakura Puppet Dance) when used on Sakura Haruno.\nWhen Mukade used it in the movie, the chakra threads wrapped around the target's limbs instead of simply connecting to them.

{"jutsu_name":"Preta Path","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu, Chakra Absorption Techniques","jutsu_description":"This article is about information on the ability. For information on the character, see Preta Path.\n\n\n\nThe Preta Path (餓鬼道, Gakidō) grants the user the ability to absorb chakra in any form. Pain channelled the Preta Path through the corpse of a Kusagakure shinobi.\nThis ability is primarily defensive in nature as it is capable of absorbing chakra from an individual through physical contact. In addition to this, the Preta Path is able to absorb ninjutsu-based techniques that are pure chakra or chakra based, thereby nullifying their effect. It doesn't absorb physical attacks, like Gaara's sand, but does drain the sand's chakra.[1] This is done by forming a barrier around the user's entire body, allowing them to absorb attacks from all directions.\nAlthough the ability is able to absorb senjutsu chakra, the user is still vulnerable to the effects of turning into a stone statue from absorbing too much of it.\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Nagato used the Preta Path to absorb Killer B's chakra while he was in his Version 2 form. He then apparently used the chakra to revitalise his body to its state before it was emaciated by the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. It also restored his hair colour back from white to red, as well as the damage done to his legs. However, presumably due to loss of muscle memory, he was not able to use the legs completely.[2]\n\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Preta realm (also known as the Hungry Ghost realm) is a reincarnation based on strong possessiveness and desire which were cultivated in a previous life or lives. The Preta are humanoid creatures which are perpetually hungry and thirsty, but are unable to satisfy themselves, living lives similar to those of hopeless addicts trying to appease their unyielding hunger. In appearance, the Preta are deathly pale, emaciated figures, which contrasts with Pain's Preta Path's hefty stature. In Hinduism Preta could also mean ghosts this also relates to the technique the Preta path uses. \n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 560, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 550, pages 17-18"}

These souls may be recalled from even the crossroad between life and the afterlife, and are then returned to their rejuvenated bodies. The exact limitations of this technique are unknown, but on one occasion, it was able to resurrect a large number of individuals who had recently died. While using this technique, the caster is severely weakened; for instance, Nagato's hair turned white as a result of overexerting his power.[2][3] Ultimately, once the technique is finished, the user invariably dies.[4]\nThis technique can also be used to transform the corpse vessel of an individual revived by Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation into a real body of living flesh and blood.[5] However, whereas the rest of the reincarnated Madara Uchiha's body was made real, his eyes instead crumbled into dust upon his resurrection. This method does not require the King of Hell to appear.[6]\nThe revived individuals are seemingly revived with a fully restored chakra level, as Kakashi did not require hospitalization to recover after revival, and was able to carry Naruto after he nearly passes out after his fight with Pain.\n\nTrivia[]\nWhen written as '輪廻転生', Rinne Tensei means \"the circle of transmigration\" or \"metempsychosis\".\nHashirama Senju identified this technique as a Six Paths Kinjutsu (六道の禁術, Rikudō no Kinjutsu, literally meaning: Six Paths Forbidden Technique).[7]\nWhen Nagato was preparing to use this technique, Konan feared for the worst due to his low chakra levels, implying she believed he could have potentially survived with more chakra.[2] However, according to the fourth databook, usage of this technique always comes at the cost of the user's life.[1]\nMadara — and Obito under the guise of Madara — noted that this technique was supposed to be used to revive him.[8][9] Madara would eventually be revived by Impure World Reincarnation instead, and expressed surprise and disappointment that his return didn't go as planned, as only a living person can become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki.[10][4] Eventually, Black Zetsu successfully forced Obito to perform this technique on Madara.[5] Obito was then able to temporarily survive the effects of using this technique due to Black Zetsu attaching to his body.[11] After this, Naruto temporarily stabilised Obito's life force using his Six Paths Yang Power like he did with Might Guy after he used the Eight Gates Released Formation, allowing him to bring back Sasuke and later battle against Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. However, as the both noted, Obito would still die as a result from using this technique.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Jin no Sho, page 251\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 449\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 510, page 17\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 614, pages 5-6\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 656, pages 14-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 657, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 637, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 453, page 18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 601, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 559, pages 1-2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 657, page 10"}

They are regarded as the seventh Pain, the Outer Path, and wield the power to control life and death itself. With this power, the user is able to revive the dead through the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique,[1] though doing so comes at the cost of the user's life.[2]\nThe Rinnegan allows for the creation of black receivers,[3] and by transmitting their chakra into these receivers, the user can bind anyone they touch through the power of the Outer Path. The user can also manifest the chakra chains of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path to restrain those who touch the receivers with an even greater binding power.[4] By implanting black receivers into corpses or reincarnated individuals, the user can reanimate and remotely control the bodies as the Six Paths of Pain. These bodies, as well as the King of Hell and the creatures summoned through the Animal Path, all have reflections of the Rinnegan in their eyes and share visual information with the user through the Outer Path.[5][6]\n\n     Souls summoned back from the Pure Land.  \nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki demonstrated the ability to recall the souls of the previous Kage from the Pure Land to assist him in summoning Team 7 and the tailed beasts back from Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's core dimension.[7] When summoned in this manner, the deceased person does not have an actual body, but appears as a mass of flickering chakra in full possession of their personality and memories. Once the user ends the technique, the summoned souls dwindle and ultimately disappear completely. Hagoromo was also able to undo another person's use of the Impure World Reincarnation technique, releasing the reincarnated souls from their vessels and sending them to the Pure Land.[8]\n\nTrivia[]\nGedō (外道, literally meaning: Outer Path), derived from the Sanskrit Tīrthika, refers to any doctrine which \"treads the outer path\" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the Naidō (内道, literally meaning: Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical.\nThe Demonic Statue of the Outer Path may have some relation to this technique, as it shares the same name. Madara Uchiha is responsible for giving the statue its name.[9]\nSome abilities of the Outer Path may only be available to those who are truly alive themselves, as Madara in his reincarnated state required another living Rinnegan wielder to revive him.[10]\nNaruto Uzumaki referred to the control of the Six Paths of Pain as an Outer Path Technique (外道の術, Gedō no Jutsu, Viz: Gedo Jutsu).[6]\nKabuto Yakushi noted that he could force Nagato to remove a person's soul with the Human Path, then store both their body and soul inside the King of Hell with the Naraka Path and revive them at a later time.

It also secretes special bodily fluids that react to contact with senjutsu chakra, causing immediate physical alternations with further controlled shape-shifting quality to the user's body, along with greatly enhanced physical capabilities. By isolating an enzyme from Jūgo's special fluids and mixing it with his own senjutsu chakra, Orochimaru created a cursed seal he could brand others with.[3][4] Orochimaru typically gives his cursed seals to either his more powerful followers or those he would like to use as his host body. \n\n    Orochimaru applying a cursed seal.  \nTo apply a cursed seal, Orochimaru bites the recipient's neck, causing the seal to appear near the puncture wound.[5][6] Recipients are rendered unconscious while their body either accepts or rejects the cursed seal. From extensive practice, Orochimaru established a 10% compatibility rate for the cursed seal; those whose bodies aren't compatible with the cursed seal will die.[7] If they do survive, the recipient will have access to the cursed seal's power boosts, access that grows through repeated use. If unused, cursed seals will grow dormant, though Orochimaru can forcefully activate them if he gains access to them.\nCursed seals seen in the anime tend to have fatal consequences even if the recipients survive the initial application. Mizuki's seal, which was a failed prototype that required extra procedures to activate, nearly kills him due to its incompleteness and causes him to lose all his powers. The cursed seals administrated to Team Guren kill them if they do not take the required medication periodically, preventing them from escaping Orochimaru's clutches. On the other hand, the seals given to the Iburi clan partially stabilised their otherwise unstable ability.\nOnce applied, removal of the cursed seal is apparently difficult. Kakashi Hatake and the Third Hokage have on separate occasions opted to suppress the cursed seals rather than remove them outright. The only times the cursed seal have been fully removed have been as a side-effect of removing Orochimaru's consciousness from the recipient's body, fragments of which are embedded in each of the cursed seals: Itachi Uchiha does so with the Sword of Totsuka; Sasuke Uchiha does so with the Evil Releasing Method. So long as part of his consciousness remains in a cursed seal somewhere, Orochimaru can never truly die.[8]\n\nMechanics[]\nWhen they first receive the cursed seal, recipients cannot control their access to it, and as such they draw on its power unwillingly. Until they become accustomed to it, use of the cursed seal will cause them intense physical pain, though they may be able to briefly ignore this.[9] While active, the cursed seal feeds off their chakra and replaces it with Orochimaru's own senjutsu chakra,[4] increasing their chakra levels ten-times and making their jutsu stronger.[10] So long as they have at least some chakra of their own, this gives them a back up reserve that they can call on, though if not employed carefully this may have fatal consequences.[1] Prolonged use of the cursed seal corrodes the mind, making them more susceptible to Orochimaru's influence.[11] In exchange, the cursed seal synchronises with their body, exponentially enhancing the abilities of their normal state.[12]\nRecipients initially only have access to the cursed seal's first level (状態1, Jōtai Ichi, literally meaning: State 1). When active, the seal's design spreads across at least half[13] of their body from its point of application, glowing and replicating as its coverage grows.[14] The degree to which this occurs is up to the user, and the degree to which it spreads is proportionate to the overall effect it has.\nIn order to increase the advantages of using the cursed seal, as well as to eliminate some of the risks and discomfort that come from using its first level, Orochimaru developed Mind Awakening Pills to advance cursed seals to their next stage. Under normal circumstances, the pills kill those who take them, requiring that they be placed in a near-death state after taking the pill while their body acclimates for the heightened transformation.[15]\n\n     Variations of the cursed seal transformations.  \nThe second level (状態2, Jōtai Ni, literally meaning: State 2) of the cursed seal causes the user's body to physically transform. Called a \"Cursed Seal Transformation\" (呪印化, Juinka, English TV: Curse Mark Transformation),[16] it is similar in appearance to Jūgo's transformations: they gain yellow irises and black sclerae, altered skin colour, longer hair, and significantly greater power.[13] When in this state, the seal eats away at the mind and personality of its user, driving them to madness if used for too long. It also takes quite a toll on their body since they are being mutated by the seal.[17] Skilled users of the cursed seal are able to isolate transformations to specific parts of the body.[18]\n\nSeals[]\nOrochimaru has various cursed seal designs, some being stronger than others. Second level transformations are always the same for a single user, but it's not known if the same cursed seal causes the same transformations in different users.\n\nCursed Seal of Heaven: Worn by Sasuke Uchiha and Anko Mitarashi.\nCursed Seal of Earth: Worn by Kimimaro.\nSound Four's Cursed Seals: Worn by Jirōbō, Kidōmaru, Tayuya, Sakon and Ukon.\nPrisoners' Cursed Seals: Worn by Ahiko, Guren, Takishi and Tsukushi.\nAnimal Cursed Seal (anime only): Worn by Mizuki.\nTeam Guren's Cursed Seals (anime only): Worn by Nurari, Kihō and Kigiri.\nIburi Clan's Cursed Seals (anime only): Worn by Gotta and Yukimi.\nTrivia[]\nCompatibility with one of Orochimaru's cursed seals in turn means one is compatible with Jūgo, allowing him to transplant his own flesh and chakra into their bodies.[19]\nOrochimaru can apply other cursed seals by biting an opponent's neck. These other cursed seals temporarily bind the target upon application, spreading across their body to restrict their movements.[20]\nOrochimaru placed a strong cursed seal on Mitsuki's heart that would cause him to self-destruct should anyone attempted to decipher his synthetic body's structure.[21] Kū claims it is an older-type of cursed seal that they can work around,[22] though the scientist found it rather difficult.[23]\nSee Also[]\nGelel Beast Mode\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Naruto chapter 66, page 15\n\n↑ First Databook, page 194\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 349, pages 9-11\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 579, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 49, pages 17-19\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 50, pages 1-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 50, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 593, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 67, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 128, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 179, pages 7-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 219, page 11\n\n↑ 13.0 13.1 Naruto: One Decade, One Hundred Ninja, page 93\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 55, pages 19-20\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 184, pages 2-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 593, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 186, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 351, pages 6-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 413, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 663, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Boruto episode 73\n\n↑ Boruto episode 84\n\n↑ Boruto episode 85"}

Despite the technique's dramatic name, it is not actually harmful. The pain is fairly extreme, however, so much so that, when Kakashi Hatake uses it on Naruto Uzumaki, Naruto comically leaps into the air,[1] travelling a fair distance. Sakura Haruno blushes to see it used and Sasuke Uchiha declares both Kakashi and Naruto \"buffoons\".[2] The anime shows those who are familiar with One Thousand Years of Death are very unwilling to be subjected to it.[3] It has no effect on unconscious targets.[4]\nNaruto later uses this technique against Gaara. Instead of his fingers, Naruto uses a kunai with an exploding tag attached. Unlike previous responses to the technique, Pakkun calls Naruto's attack \"brilliant\".[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique's full name is \"Konohagakure Hiden Secret Taijutsu Technique: One Thousand Years of Death\" (木ノ葉隠れ秘伝体術奥義・千年殺し, Konohagakure Hiden Taijutsu Ōgi: Sennen Goroshi, Viz: Konohagakure's Most Secret and Sacred Technique: One Thousand Years of Death, English TV: Hidden Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu: One Thousand Years of Death, UK DVD: Secret Ninja Technique of the Hidden Leaf School, Death for 1000 Years, English Games \"Sacred Taijutsu: 1000 Years of Death\").\nThe official name for this technique is Sennen Goroshi. However, the name is sometimes thought erroneously to be Sennen Gurushi (千年苦し), meaning something along the lines of \"Thousand Years of Pain\".\nThis technique is modelled after the Kanchō, a Japanese prank common among children.\nIn chapter 5 of Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles, Sakumo Hatake is said to be a user of the technique.

{"jutsu_name":"Omnipotence","jutsu_type":"Shinjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the shinjutsu.  For other uses, see Omnipotence (disambiguation).\n\n\n\nOmnipotence is a shinjutsu claimed to be used only by a god, whose effect is to bring out the user's desires. It is described as a programming language that Gods have used to create worlds and to make anything real. Because of this ability, Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki declared this technique to be the most powerful shinjutsu.\nAkin to genjutsu, this power is capable of affecting the mind of others, but unlike other genjutsu, this jutsu can be used on a far greater scale. Similar to the Infinite Tsukuyomi, this jutsu can be used on a worldwide scale, manipulating the memories of everyone on the planet to how the user sees fit.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Countering\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nModified by Amado Sanzu with Shibai Ōtsutsuki's genes, Ada inherited this power. However, because she is not an actual Ōtsutsuki, she has no conscious control of this technique, only able to instinctively use it to grant her deepest desires. Her first known use of this shinjutsu was charming everyone, both male and female, around her with her desire to find true love.[1] The symptoms of the charm affect everyone differently: headaches, vertigo, fever, impaired judgement, and stiffened muscles from extreme tension are the known symptoms.[2] The only exceptions to the charm are family members and the Ōtsutsuki clan.\nLater, desiring to please Kawaki, along with channeling Kawaki's desire for Boruto to be viewed as an outsider like him, Ada’s subconscious caused this power to rewrite the memories of everyone on a global scale, even those removed from the dimension Omnipotence was cast in, to perceive Kawaki as the son of the Seventh Hokage and Boruto as the outsider taken in by the Hokage, effectively making the two switch lives with each other. Beyond the initial rewrite, over the next three years, Omnipotence also suppressed any lingering sense of contradiction in those affected, such as Kawaki's body being modified by Kara despite supposedly being born and raised in Konoha, as well as Momoshiki's absence, and those confronted about the changes become more stubborn in their refusal, even if they are confronted with visual evidence. When Sarada and Sumire consulted Ada, she thought it was impossible to reverse the change, finding it more practical to rewrite new memories, which carried its own risks.[3] Even the concept of Omnipotence is removed from the minds it affects, so if someone is told that the memory rewrite took place, the knowledge about it will fade.[4]\n\nCountering[]\nMomoshiki claimed that killing the technique's user won't undo its effects. Ada similarly found it more likely that the affected majority would think the immune minority were the ones whose memories were tampered with if anyone tried reasoning with them. Despite being affected, Sasuke seemed to be able to avoid the lingering effects of the changes by focusing on the initial contradictions right after the memory rewriting took effect. Three years in, Mitsuki was taken aback by Kawaki's harsh treatment of him, and took notice of these feelings. Similarly, Amado was able to recognise his own alterations in Kawaki's body, deducing his own memories must have been altered. Hearing a report on Amado's theory, Shikamaru Nara began recognising that puzzling situations made more sense when memory alteration was considered. If one is able to realise the truth that memories were altered without learning about Omnipotence, accepting as truth by themselves, is possible to retain some of that knowledge, something Boruto considers \"no mean feat\".[4]\nKoji Kashin, who managed to awaken his Shinjutsu, Ten Directions, before Omnipotence was cast, was able to see all possible futures, allowing him to notice the true history of Boruto's position, despite his own altered perception that Kawaki was the \"Seventh Hokage's son\", thus concluding that his memory was altered.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nUpon hearing Amado's explanation of Ada's ability to enchant all, Momoshiki, who claims to be aware of all shinjutsu, initially assumed the \"love charm power\" cannot be shinjutsu,[6] though after concluding the origin of it,[7] identified its true nature as a shinjutsu.[1][8]\nThe official Naruto website calls Ada's expression of Omnipotence \"The Ability to Beguile All Humanity\" (全人類を「魅了」する能力, Zen jinrui o \"miryō\" suru nōryoku).[9]\nThe official Naruto website states that Omnipotence was used to create the current world.[10]\nFor reasons unknown, Sarada Uchiha and Sumire Kakei seem to be immune to Omnipotence cast by Ada.\nAccording to Momoshiki, those who are immune to the technique are the ones who will suffer the most from it.[8]\nSee Also[]\nCreation of All Things Technique\nIzanagi\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Boruto chapter 79, page 34-36\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 69, page 30\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 1\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 7, page 35\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 13, pages 20-22\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 75, page 36\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 76, page 39\n\n↑ 8.0 8.1 Boruto chapter 79, page 40\n\n↑ Boruto Database: The Ability to Beguile All Humanity\n\n↑ Boruto Database: Omnipotence"}

The enhanced regeneration granted by this technique is so rapid that even the wounds that resulted from Tsunade being impaled by two gigantic swords were completely healed mere moments after their removal.[3] As it builds on the Creation Rebirth, it shortens the user's lifespan.[1]\nUse of the technique also requires the release of the Strength of a Hundred Seal, but rather than just covering the face, the markings extend over the user's entire body. As a testament to both its power and her confidence in its healing prowess, Tsunade has decreed that only medical-nin who have mastered this technique are permitted to break the first three rules that govern their role on the battlefield — which effectively prohibit their direct involvement in any conflict — that she herself established. This makes herself and her student, Sakura, the only ones allowed to break these rules.[4]\nThis technique's power can be temporarily transferred to another person upon physical contact, as seen when Sakura extended the technique's markings onto Obito Uchiha.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nWhen written as '白毫', byakugō means 'Ūrṇā' (literally meaning: Fine White Hair), which is a white swirl of fine hair on the forehead of the Buddha, represented in art by a spiral or a dot, or even a gem or pearl.

{"jutsu_name":"Nine-Tails Chakra Mode","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Chakra Flow","jutsu_description":"The Nine-Tails Chakra Mode is a unique form of transformation that is granted to the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Attributes\n2 Forms\n\n2.1 Kurama Mode\n2.2 Tailed Beast Mode\n\n\n3 Senjutsu Influence\n\n3.1 Combination with Six Paths Sage Mode\n3.2 Asura Kurama Mode\n\n\n4 Baryon Mode\n5 Trivia\n6 See Also\n7 References\n\n\nAttributes[]\nThe Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and its related forms coat the user's body in yellow chakra, which emanates from them reminiscent of flickering flames;[4][5] in the anime, Minato Namikaze's is also surrounded by a slight dark aura.[6] The form's design differs between users and can even change over time,[1] but certain features are consistent across all forms: two horns on their head, six magatama markings around their neck, some sort of prominent circular/swirl design over their stomach, and various other lines extending along their body.\nLike all jinchūriki transformations, the user's physical abilities are enhanced while the mode is active, with greater enhancements coming from using more of the Nine-Tails' chakra. While using just the basic Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto Uzumaki is strong enough to defeat members of the White Zetsu Army with a single kick[7] and fast enough to dodge the Fourth Raikage using his Lightning Release: Body Flicker Technique.[8] The chakra that surrounds the user also helps in protecting them from damage, allowing them to take lava and boil-based attacks and suffer only minor injuries.[9] Naruto is even able to survive Tenpenchii because of his protective cloak, though the cloak itself is lost in the process.[10] The user's scent and chakra signature also change.[11]\nFrom the chakra that surrounds them, users are able to produce chakra arms as a way to interact with their surroundings or improve their manoeuvrability. Naruto primarily uses the arms to help him form the Rasengan and its variants, having the arms assist with the shape or nature transformation that he usually relies on shadow clones for.[12]\n\nForms[]\nNaruto's Yang Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.Minato's Yin Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.1/2\nWhile using Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, users' eyes become orange but their pupils remain the same. Like previous jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails, Naruto is able to sense negative emotions while he's in this form,[13] seemingly regardless of distance[14] or obstructions.[15] He also releases a powerful life force while the mode is active, causing wood constructs to quickly mature into full-grown trees when he's nearby[5] and White Zetsus to become trees when he comes in contact with them.[16]\n\n    The initial risk of Naruto using Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.  \nDespite the passive abilities and enhancements he gains, Naruto's use of the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode is initially marked by limitations due to the Nine-Tails refusing to cooperate with him. This prevents him from using Tailed Beast Balls while in this form,[17] though he is eventually able to create miniature versions.[18] Because Naruto \"shelves\" his own chakra in this form and instead draws on the Nine-Tails', his early uses of it come with a risk that the Nine-Tails will take that shelved chakra, resulting in Naruto's death. Naruto must, therefore, be careful of how long he uses the form for and how many shadow clones he creates, as doing too many only increases the risk.[19] The Nine-Tails eventually stops trying to take Naruto's chakra,[20] and soon after that, starts cooperating, removing these limitations.[21]\n\nKurama Mode[]\nNaruto's Yang Kurama Mode.Naruto's complete Kurama Mode.1/2\nOnce Naruto learns the Nine-Tails' name - Kurama - their hearts synchronise and Naruto becomes able to enter what is referred to as Kurama Mode (九喇嘛モード, Kurama Mōdo).[22] His pupils becomes slitted, the whisker-like markings on his face become thicker to resemble the ☰ trigram, and the chakra shroud's shape alters to resemble a full-length haori, similar to the one Minato usually wears.[23] For all intents and purposes, Kurama Mode is a completed version of Nine-Tails Chakra Mode: Tailed Beast Mode without the full transformation, meaning that Naruto is able to use Tailed Beast Balls.[22] He can partially manifest parts of Kurama's body if needed, such as its head[24] and tails.[25] In The Last: Naruto the Movie, Naruto is shown isolating the Kurama Mode transformation to one hand.\nNaruto is able to transfer his and Kurama's chakra to others, granting them tailless version 1-like chakra shrouds that greatly enhance their techniques: Hinata Hyūga, for example, is able to deflect one of the Ten-Tails' tails with a single Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm.[26] Kakashi Hatake states that the power and volume of the transferred chakra is even greater than when Kurama earlier directly handed chakra to him, which had improved his Kamui at least three-fold.[27] Despite Kurama's contribution, C claims the transferred chakra more closely resembles Naruto's own.[28]\n\n\nTailed Beast Mode[]\nMain article: Tailed Beast Mode\n\n     Minato and Naruto in Tailed Beast Mode.  \nNaruto and Minato are able to create full-size replicas of Kurama. Whereas other jinchūriki's Tailed Beast Modes cause them to fully transform into their respective tailed beast, Naruto and Minato's are instead an alteration of their earlier chakra cloaks changed to resemble Kurama: Naruto's is the same translucent golden colour as his earlier cloak, while Minato's is a much darker orange colour with both having similar black lines all across its body.[23] Minato is able to enter this form directly from Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, while Naruto must initially first enter Kurama Mode.[29] Naruto is initially limited to only using this form for five minutes because he hasn't perfected his bond with Kurama,[23] but with practice they extend this to eight minutes,[30] and then again to some unspecified limit.\nWhile Tailed Beast Mode is active, Naruto and Minato hover within the construct's head. They can in fact allow others to enter the construct as well, extending its protection to them and allowing Kurama to heal their wounds and replenish their chakra.[31] Because it isn't a proper transformation, Naruto and Minato can still use their other jutsu from within this form, such as the Rasengan and Shadow Clone Technique,[32] and can even use the construct's tails as chakra arms.[33] Kurama is able to speak through this replica and can be granted control of it;[31] in The Last: Naruto the Movie, Naruto is shown manifesting the construct separately from himself, with Kurama in control.\n\nSenjutsu Influence[]\n     Naruto's combination of Kurama Mode and Sage Mode.  \nNaruto can combine his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode and its various forms with Sage Mode to further enhance his abilities with the power of senjutsu.[34] His pupils become a combination of the two forms: the vertical fox-slits with the horizontal toad-slits. Naruto notes he can absorb natural energy more quickly than usual while in Kurama Mode.[35] After meeting Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki during the Fourth Shinobi World War, these abilities are further augmented by the powers of the Six Paths Sage Mode and the Six Paths Senjutsu.\n\n\nCombination with Six Paths Sage Mode[]\nMain article: Six Paths Sage Mode\n\nNaruto's initial mode after receiving Hagoromo's power.Naruto's second mode in the Boruto anime.Naruto's initial mode during Boruto: Naruto the Movie.Naruto's second mode during Boruto: Naruto the Movie.Naruto's initial mode in the Boruto manga.Naruto's second mode in the Boruto manga.1/6\nAfter receiving Hagoromo's power, Naruto gains the ability to use the Six Paths Sage Mode, and the initial appearance of his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode while simultaneously using it changes: his body is coated in yellow chakra; a sort of circular design is featured prominently over his stomach; the whisker-like markings on his face become thicker to resemble the ☰ trigram; six magatama markings are present on or around his collar; various other dark designs appear along his body, sometimes densely enough to give the appearance that he's wearing a body suit beneath the yellow coat. A pattern consisting of a Rinnegan-like marking above nine magatama also appears on his back.[36] His eyes become yellow and his skin does not glow along with the rest of his outfit when activated.[37] However, these same features are absent in later uses: the back pattern being gone, and his chakra mode once again consisting of orange eyes and yellow glowing skin like his chakra modes before he met Hagoromo.[38][39] The one consistent hallmark of Six Paths Sage Mode are Naruto's eyes: while his pupils maintain the cross of vertical fox-slits with horizontal toad-slats, there is no pigmentation around his eyes that would otherwise signify the standard Sage Mode.[40] When Naruto uses the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode in conjunction with Six Paths Sage Mode, his abilities are pushed even further, demonstrated by him becoming fast enough to catch Kaguya Ōtsutsuki off guard[41] and durable enough to take a Chidori unharmed.[42]\n\nAsura Kurama Mode[]\n     Naruto's Asura Kurama Mode.  \nAfter obtaining the Six Paths Senjutsu, Naruto retains the ability to enter Tailed Beast Mode,[42] which, in terms of size and strength, is comparable to Sasuke Uchiha's Complete Body — Susanoo.[43] Through the use of shadow clones, Naruto has shown the ability to combine three Kurama avatars into a single construct with three faces and six arms,[44] which greatly resembles his ancestor Asura Ōtsutsuki's own chakra avatar.[45] This form is known as \"Asura Kurama Mode\" (アシュラクラマモード, Ashura Kurama Mōdo).[46] This mode allowed Naruto to use the Six Paths: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken, which was able to match Sasuke's strongest attack and cause the Valley of the End and the surrounding area to be devastated.[47]\n\nBaryon Mode[]\nMain article: Baryon Mode\n\n     Naruto's Baryon Mode.  \nWhen Naruto and Kurama both use their chakra and form the final form of the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, Naruto retains most of his human form, but some of Kurama's features mesh with Naruto's. This mode allows Naruto to have high speed, dodging Isshiki's high speed rods, something Sasuke has trouble with even with his Sharingan. However, because it consumes a lot of the users' chakra, Naruto cannot maintain this form for as long.\n\nTrivia[]\n     Naruto's face in the original colourised chapters.  \nPrior to Naruto entering Kurama Mode for the first time, the markings on Naruto's chakra shroud would extend further along his arms and legs whenever he attempted to form the Tailed Beast Rasengan, causing his cloak to briefly progress toward its complete form.[48][49][50]\nKurama's golden chakra and approximate age of a millennia evoke the \"Sky Fox\" (天狐, tenko), kitsune who gain golden fur upon growing their ninth tail and reaching 1,000 years of age. They become equivalent to kami and ascend to the heavens.\nIn the anime's Power arc, Naruto temporarily assumes an incomplete version of the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode after breaking free from Kurama's influence. During his brief time in the form, Naruto is able to form an incomplete Tailed Beast Rasengan, use chakra arms, and enter an imperfect version of the Tailed Beast Mode, although it lacked legs and possessed only six tails.\nWhen Minato first entered this mode, his bangs spiked upward and his chakra cloak gained horns similar to those of his son. His hairstyle, however, reverted to its original state in the latter part of chapter 639.\nIn the colourised versions of chapters 676 and 678 included in digital editions of Weekly Shōnen Jump, Naruto's skin in this mode was depicted as yellow and his eyes had orange irides, much like his previous transformations. Later illustrations coloured by Masashi Kishimoto instead depict Naruto with his original skin colour and yellow irides. The colouration was corrected in subsequent chapters and the Naruto: Colour Edition release of volume 71.\nHagoromo attributes the presence of Kurama's chakra alongside Indra's and Asura's to his emergence from Madara's lower body as the Ten-Tail's jinchūriki after Kaguya's restoration.[51]\nSee Also[]\nLava Release Chakra Mode\nLightning Release Chakra Mode\nTenseigan Chakra Mode\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Retsu no Sho, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 519, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 538, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 499, pages 12-15\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 505, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 374\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 545, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 544, page 11-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 565, pages 11-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 629, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 559, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 551, pages 13-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 534, pages 13-14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 545, pages 5-6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 529, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 545, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 520, pages 1-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 595, pages 4-6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 519, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 567, page 18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 570, page 10-15\n\n↑ 22.0 22.1 Fourth Databook, page 250\n\n↑ 23.0 23.1 23.2 Naruto chapter 571\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 598, pages 1-2, 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 600, pages 14-16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 616, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 617, pages 3-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 616, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 645, pages 6-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 611, page 6\n\n↑ 31.0 31.1 Naruto chapter 610, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 645, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 572, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 645, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 645, pages 6-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 673, page 17\n\n↑ Volume 70 cover\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 700+4, pages 4-7\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto the Movie\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 672, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 687, page 16\n\n↑ 42.0 42.1 Naruto chapter 695, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 695\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 696, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 670, page 17\n\n↑ The name comes from the Studio Pierrot blog.\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 697, pages 1-3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 519, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 520, page 1\n\n↑ Volume 55 cover\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 686, page 1"}

{"jutsu_name":"Nine-Tailed Naruto Wild Attack","jutsu_type":"Taijutsu","jutsu_description":"In his initial jinchūriki form, Naruto first rushes forward with a shoulder charge. Once he connects, he then unleashes a brutal series of claw slashes until he rise-slashes ending with a downward slash, then in an instant releases all built up chakra in a powerful Nine-Tails Burst which blasts away the victim.\n\nTrivia[]\nWhile Kakashi can copy this with his Sharingan in the first Clash of Ninja game with no special effects on the claw slashes, it is beyond his ability as of Clash of Ninja 2.\nDespite this secret technique requiring an initial blow, the fact that it is not a cinematic-based attack causes each blow to be affected normally by damage scaling.\nIn both Clash of Ninja 1 and 2, this attack's tracking even when it connects properly tends to be inconsistent enough to allow the victim to escape (especially against walls at a specific angle). This was eventually fixed somewhat as of Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 3, where the attack locks the target in place properly throughout the sequence.\nAlso as of Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 3, the attack cuts out an animation before the first claw slash in the sequence from the prior instalments, reducing the overall hits by one.\nAlso as of 3, the initial blow provides the incorrect type of hitstun for a re-stand state into the sequence if landed during a juggle. As a result, the combo counter will reset just before the barrage of attacks occurs, and thus damage scaling will not occur normally (though the victim is still not able to block during their landing lag).\nIn the Wii sub-series, shining claw effects are added that slash across the screen per strike.\nThis technique was Naruto's ultimate technique in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes, where it was named \"Nine-Tails Barrage\".\nLikewise, there is a stronger version of this attack known as \"Ultimate Nine-Tailed Naruto Wild Attack\" (究極九尾ナルト乱撃, Kyūkyoku Kyūbi Naruto Rangeki) in the Japanese versions of Naruto: Ninja Council 3; this version is performed in his single-tailed Version 1 form, with its one of its motions involving the grounded-claw-drag based on the 133rd episode of the anime."}

Special.\n\nTrivia[]\nIn some Japanese sources, the naming of this type of attack also applies to Naruto's jumping strong attack in this state as well (which is a burst of energy shot as a projectile downward, but moreso is considered to be a Great Roar instead).\nThis attack is based off of the invisible surge launched at Sasuke upon Naruto entering his Version 1 form for the first time in the original anime/manga.\nWhen used in EX 3, the attack is instead performed with the motion/animation being one of Three-Tailed Naruto's basic attacks.\nHowever, as of Revolution 3 and Special, the original animation from Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 4 is reused.\nIf the attack is somehow used up close enough in the Wii-subseries, it instead slightly jerks the target back instead of causing them to crumple."}

Shouting \"flow\" (流, ryū), he then dashes forward at such an extreme speed that the space ahead of the user is distorted, making it impossible for the target to defend against it. Guy then deals an immensely powerful kick which carries such force that it is capable of obliterating the target's body, as well as creating a devastating shock wave linear to the kick. The damage itself was so great that even Madara Uchiha as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki feared for his life.\nThe recoil was such that it completely shattered the bones in Guy's striking leg.

{"jutsu_name":"Nine Masked Beasts","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques, Barrier Ninjutsu, Chakra Absorption Techniques","jutsu_description":"The Nine Masked Beasts (九面獣, Kumenjū) are entities created by Menma through the use of the Black Nine-Tails' chakra. Five of these beasts are described as divine beasts (神獣, shinjū), while the other four are referred to as divine priests (神官, shinkan).[1]\nMenma summons them by forming a tiger seal, declaring \"Nine Mask Svāhā\" (「九面蘇婆訶」, \"Kumen Sowaka\") and chanting the kuji-in, which conjures a massive mandala featuring each kanji of the kuji-in encircled by nine rings, arrayed in the same cross pattern he wears on his cloak. Each of the masked beasts emerges from a specific ring.\n\nSeiryū (青龍, literally meaning: Azure Dragon), a dragon that resembles a seahorse. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 青 (sei, \"azure\").\nByakko (白虎, literally meaning: White Tiger), a lean and slender tiger. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 白 (byaku, \"white\").\nSuzaku (朱雀, literally meaning: Vermilion Bird), a bird with elegant and dramatic plumage. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 朱 (shu, \"vermilion\").\nGenbu (玄武, literally meaning: Black Tortoise), a tortoise with a shell made of overlapping plates. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 玄 (gen, \"black\").\nKinja (金蛇, literally meaning: Golden Snake), a massive serpent with golden scales. It can bind opponents by wrapping its body around them. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 空 (kū, \"sky\").\nTennyo (天女, literally meaning: Celestial Maiden), an angelic priestess with flowing robes. It uses translucent ribbons to whip at opponents. Like the Kinja, it can also bind opponents. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 玉 (gyoku, \"jewel\").\nShinigami (死神, literally meaning: Death God), a priest that resembles a skeleton and carries a scythe. A swing of this scythe unleashes sickle-like energy waves which drain targets of their chakra once they have passed through them. The waves can bypass the barriers set up by Hokuto Sennin and Nanto Sennin. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 三 (san, \"three\").\nHokuto Sennin (北斗仙人, literally meaning: Northern Sage), a priest with a fox staff. In unison with the Nanto Sennin, it can trap opponents in purple cylindrical barriers. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 北 (hoku, \"north\").\nNanto Sennin (南斗仙人, literally meaning: Southern Sage), the matching counterpart of Hokuto Sennin. In unison with the Hokuto Sennin, it can trap opponents in purple cylindrical barriers. Emerges from the ring bearing the kanji 南 (nan, \"south\").\nWhen defeated, they revert to their true forms, which are nine masked fox kits (子狐, kogitsune) that each possess a single tail. They can also convert back into chakra that will arc through the air from their present location back to Menma. Once they collide with Menma, they reform into the Black Nine-Tails. \n\nSeiryūByakkoSuzakuGenbuKinjaTennyoShinigamiHokuto Sennin and Nanto SenninA Masked Beast's true form\nTrivia[]\nAmong the Nine Masked Beasts, Seiryū, Byakko, Suzaku, and Genbu are based on the group of divine beasts known as the Four Symbols, and Kinja is based on the legendary Huang Long itself. Tennyo and Shinigami are based on the heavenly messengers and the death god of Japanese folklore, respectively. Hokuto Sennin and Nanto Sennin, which are named after the Northern and Southern Dippers, are original concepts designed to round out the group.\nThe seahorse-like appearance of Seiryū is based on the Japanese legends that seahorses are children of dragons. The Japanese word for \"seahorse\" literally means \"baby dragon\" (竜の落し子, tatsu no otoshigo).\nWhile summoning the Nine Masked Beasts, Menma refers to svāhā (薩婆訶, sowaka), a Buddhist term roughly meaning \"calling\" which is used in mantras. He also chants the kuji-in, which are featured as kanji on the portals. The kanji also corresponds to the nine rings worn by the Akatsuki members.\nInterestingly, the orientation of the portals appears to be reverse that of the traditional. In Menma's mandala, north points south while south points north. In addition, the Four Symbols traditionally have Seiryū point east, Byakko point west, Suzaku point south, and Genbu point north; these are flipped for the Nine Masked Beasts. However, Kinja emerges from the central portal, which conforms to tradition as a parallel to the Huang Long.\nMenma uses the Nine Masked Beasts to overwhelm his opponents with numbers, similar to Naruto's use of the Shadow Clone Technique or Nagato's use of the Six Paths of Pain.\nSee Also[]\nCreation of All Things Technique\nSix Paths of Pain\nWhite Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto Stealth Volume: Road to Ninja (ＮＡＲＵＴＯ―ナルト―巻ノ忍　ＲＯＡＤ　ＴＯ　ＮＩＮＪＡ, Naruto Maki no Shinobi: Road to Ninja) page 77"}

It's unclear if he used this ability, since he had not entered his Chakra Mode.\nDespite Minato Namikaze having mastered full control of Yin-Kurama sealed inside of him, he didn't demonstrate access to this technique.\nThanks to this technique, Naruto was key in weeding out the transformed White Zetsu Army clones that were wreaking havoc on the Allied Shinobi Forces during the first night of the Fourth Shinobi World War.\nIn Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison, Satori possessed a similar ability, though it could only sense fear.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 545, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 496, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 505, pages 9-10"}

For information on the character, see Naraka Path.\n\n\n\nThe Naraka Path (地獄道, Jigokudō) grants the user two main abilities: interrogation and restoration, by using the King of Hell. Pain channelled the power of the Naraka Path through the body of a priest.\nThe Naraka Path ability makes heavy use of the King of Hell. The King of Hell is a large head which sprouts out of the ground surrounded by purple flames. It also possesses the Rinnegan as well as the shared field of vision along with the other summons.[2]\nTo interrogate, the Naraka Path need only catch hold of a person, causing the King of Hell to appear before them. With the victim seemingly paralysed, the Naraka Path begins questioning them. After answers are given, the King of Hell will unzip its mouth to release tendril-like arms and would draw out an apparition of the victim's life force energy in the form of an enlarged tongue. The King of Hell would then proceed to pass its judgement. If the person was lying or refused to answer the questions, the King of Hell would remove their tongue and consume it, apparently killing them. However, if they told the truth, they would be spared, although left extremely exhausted. \nThe second ability the Naraka Path possessed is the ability to repair any damage. To do so the Naraka Path has the King of Hell ingest the damaged body with its tendril-like arms into its mouth, then, after some time, the destroyed body will emerge from its mouth, completely rejuvenated. It did this for example to the Asura Path after it was destroyed by Chōji and Chōza Akimichi. With its restorative abilities, the Naraka Path can easily be regarded as the most valuable body if the Six Paths of Pain is being used through six different bodies. During formation, Nagato puts the Naraka Path at the rear behind the sentimental Deva Path with the other four taking the front lines. \nKabuto Yakushi stated that a Naraka Path user can transport bodies and souls using the King of Hell.[3]\n\nInfluences[]\nNaraka (Sanskrit: नरक) is the Sanskrit word for the underworld. In Hinduism it is a place where souls are sent for the expiation of their sins. Yama is the Lord of Justice and the King of Hell. He assigns appropriate punishments to living beings after death. For example, he might immerse them in boiling oil. If you lie to him, he will rip out your tongue.\nIn Buddhism, the Naraka realm, or \"hell realm\", is a plane of rebirth, based on Karma (actions of body, speech, and mind) built up in a previous life or lives. There are various Naraka, each containing beings that are tormented until their Karma has achieved its full and satisfactory results. The beings can then be reborn into a higher plane.\nThe Naraka are superficially similar to the Christian hell or purgatory, although there are many significant differences.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 254\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 422, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 551, page 8"}

Users must be careful to only use as much chakra as is needed for the specific injury. If too much chakra is sent into the body, this can disrupt the body's circulation, putting it into a comatose state.[1]\nBecause of the level of chakra control required to safely use this technique, few medical-nin can actually perform it;[1] when Sakura Haruno is learning how to use it, she's shown practising on a fish.[3] When Sarada Uchiha practised it on a fish, she sent too much chakra and caused it to eventually burn up.[4] The anime states that the different hidden villages have all developed their own applications for this technique that are unknown to other villages; in Kirigakure's case, its medics can use it as a remedy for seasickness.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe \"senjutsu\" in this technique's name is unrelated to the senjutsu used elsewhere in the series. In this technique's case, it is a reference to the secret of immortality the legendary real-life sages allegedly had.\nThis technique is possibly derived from the real-life spiritual practice of Reiki, commonly known as palm- or hands-on-healing.\nKabuto Yakushi has been shown using the Mystical Palm Technique from a short distance away, without directly touching the person he's healing.[6]\nSakura is likewise shown healing an injury to herself, seemingly without using her hands at all.[7][8]\nSee Also[]\nChakra Scalpel\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Rin no Sho, page 198\n\n↑ Naruto x Boruto: Ninja Tribes\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 238, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Boruto episode 152\n\n↑ Boruto episode 236\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 296, pages 12-13\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 343\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 274, page 4"}

This chakra is easily manipulated into various shapes to create techniques, making it one of the most versatile jutsu around. These techniques are honed through Star Training, which requires the ninja to spend large amounts of time focusing on their chakra and meditating in the presence of the meteorite. \n\nDrawbacks[]\n     Mizura showing the side effects from the radiation poisoning.  \nThe meteorite's radiation greatly increases user's chakra strength and levels, but the same enhanced chakra is highly dangerous, potentially causing great damage to their physical body. Even for those who master the technique, there is still a high chance that their body will slowly weaken and eventually perish. At least three people (including Sumaru's father, Hotarubi, who dies from extensive exposure), show severe physical trauma. This led the Third Hoshikage to ban the training. With the meteor's destruction after Akahoshi's defeat, the training became lost forever.\n\nVariants[]\nBeast (獣, Kemono): The chakra feathers change to the form of an animal, such as a dog. The chakra that the beast is made of is dense enough to repel shuriken thrown at it.Join (合, Go, English TV: Synthesis): Combines two chakra beasts into one larger beast.Destroy (斬, Zan, English TV: Cut): The chakra feathers are used to attack.Wings (翼, Yoku): The chakra feathers form wings strong enough to support a normal sized human in short flight.The chakra feathers turn into ropes to ensnare and strangle a target.If the user is close to death, they can use their remaining chakra to draw a symbol in the ground which allows them to temporarily resurrect themselves as a ghost-like apparition to even the score with whoever killed them. This apparition can seemingly deflect attacks, use any moves it could in life and be cloned through another's use of the Shadow Clone Technique.Dragon (龍, Ryū): After implanting the star into himself, Akahoshi formed a dragon that could shoot blasts of star chakra at the opponent, and can also grow wings to increase its power.Chakra Rope (チャクラの縄, Chakura no Nawa): The user extends their chakra into a binding rope that cannot be cut.Chakra Predation (チャクラの捕食, Chakura no Hoshoku): The user steals star chakra from another comrade and devours it, making their own stronger.\nTrivia[]\nWhen Akahoshi implanted the meteorite into himself, a spectral dragon was formed.

Creating even a single shadow clone will require half of a user's chakra, for which reason the normal Shadow Clone Technique is generally only safe to use for jōnin.[2] Because of how many clones are created with the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, the chakra cost is far greater, rendering it unsafe to use for most people other than the Hokage. For this reason, the First Hokage declared it forbidden and hid it away in the Scroll of Seals. Naruto Uzumaki is among the few exceptions to this rule because of the sheer amount of chakra he has access to.[1]\nThere is no established number of created clones separating the regular Shadow Clone Technique from the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique. Average users tend to make no more than five shadow clones at a time with the regular version, whereas Naruto will make dozens, hundreds, or sometimes even a thousand with the Multiple version. Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day takes it in the opposite direction, showing Naruto use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique yet only managing to make two clones because of how tired he is. Naruto sometimes doesn't even differentiate between the two techniques, simply saying \"Shadow Clone Technique\" regardless of how many clones he creates.\nWhereas a small number of clones can be useful in a variety of ways, the huge number of clones created for this technique are almost exclusively used offensively, overwhelming opponents with countless attacks from all around.[3] Naruto also utilises the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique while creating the Wind Release: Rasengan, completing years' worth of training within a matter of days.[4]\n\nTrivia[]\nAt the end of Prologue — Land of Waves, Kakashi claims to not have enough chakra to defeat Gatō's thugs.

When performed, the Akimichi grows in size, proportionately increasing their weight and strength and thus making their physical attacks more powerful.[1] Clothes they're wearing will change in size to accomodate them, as will certain weaponry, such as the bo.[2] Such a significant change in size places a great burden on the user's body.[1] In keeping with this, users typically are not seen maintaining the Multi-Size Technique for long periods of time, instead reverting back to their normal form after they've concluded their series of attacks.[3] During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Chōza and Chōji Akimichi at one point seem to use the Multi-Size Technique for several hours.[4]\nThere are two ways the Multi-Size has been depicted in the series. The first is where the user becomes extremely round, with most of the body's expansion being applied to their torso; because this is what happens to Chōchō Akimichi when she uses it, she dislikes performing it.[5] The second is where the user simply becomes larger, bigger than their normal size but not so big as when they use the Super Multi-Size Technique.[6] In the manga, Chōji uses the first during Part I and the second during Part II and onwards, suggesting the user's age or experience has something to do with it. Episodes of the anime set during Part II occasionally show Chōji using the first version, instead suggesting the two versions are interchangeable.[7][8]\n\nTrivia[]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, use of the Multi-Size Technique is shown to produce extra markings under the user's eyes.[6] Such markings are not present in earlier depictions.\nIn Naruto Retsuden, Chōji uses the Multi-Size Technique in response to a poison needle he's struck by. Because the needle would only have enough poison to kill a regular-sized person, it would be harmless to his enlarged body.

The user then jumps into the air in a  distinctive stance and begins punching the enemy repeatedly. The punches are so fast, they are set ablaze by sheer speed and friction which in turn creates a peacock-like fan of flames around the opponent. Once the attack is finished, the enemy will be sent crashing back to the ground, covered with the attack's aura. The fire produced is strong enough to burn through Saiken's Wisdom Wolf Decay,[2] and evaporates hundreds of water sharks.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles, Rock Lee used his version of this move called Morning Gorilla (朝ゴリラ, Asa Gorira).

The black figures move slowly towards their target, provoking the target into attacking. Each time the figures are struck, the attacks pass through them, only briefly disfiguring their form. With each attack they receive, the figures multiply.[1]\nBecause this is only a genjutsu, the black figures cannot do any actual harm to their targets. However, if users - while hiding nearby - coordinate their attacks with the figures', such as by secretly throwing kunai along the same trajectory, targets may not realise the kunai are real and thus won't know to dodge until it's too late.

By focusing on a particular target, she can perceive its characteristics, location, and movements with great detail.[1] She can even deduce its particular nature.[4] These attributes afford her the ability to perceive fluctuations in a person's chakra made when they are moulding it, lying, or if someone, including herself, is under a genjutsu.[5][6]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe name comes from the word Kagura (神楽, divine entertainment), which is a type of Japanese theatrical dance, considered by some to have been developed by the goddess Ame-no-Uzume.

{"jutsu_name":"Mind Body Switch Technique","jutsu_type":"Hiden, Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Mind Body Switch Technique is the signature technique of the Yamanaka clan.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Trivia\n3 See Also\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nThe user converts their consciousness to spiritual energy, which they send at a target. Their consciousness moves slowly towards the target and travels in a straight line. If the user misses their target, it will take several minutes for their consciousness to find its way back to their own body. To prevent this from happening, the Mind Body Switch should only be used against targets that are stationary or that are restrained. When their consciousness does successfully make it to the target, the user supplants the target's mind and takes total control of their body.[2]\nThe Mind Body Switch is ideal for intelligence-gathering, and in fact that's why it was originally created;[1] the target's body can be used to explore locations that the user can't enter and read documents that the user can't access.[3] Users can take advantage of the target's physical abilities, such as a bird's flight to better recon an area.[4] Users can also perform their own jutsu while possessing another, notably their sensory skills.[5] While possessing another's body, users can communicate with their targets.[6]\nOrdinarily, the Mind Body Switch lasts until the user chooses to release it. Targets with strong wills can force users from their body, something that becomes easier to do if the user is low on chakra.[7] While a user is possessing a target, their own body is left inert. This isn't necessarily an issue in one-on-one encounters, but when facing multiple opponents this leaves their body vulnerable to attack. Furthermore, any damage the possessed body receives is done to their original body as well.[8] It is for this reason that Yamanaka are so often teamed with members of the Akimichi and Nara clans; the Akimichi keeps opponents at a distance, and Nara can use their shadow to manipulate the Yamanaka's body.[6] Strategically, the user can eliminate a number of the technique's weaknesses by completely trading bodies with a target, transferring the latter's consciousness to the user's body.[5] In the anime, the Akuta, are immune to this technique.[9]\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique utilises spiritual energy, making it likely to be Yin Release.\nRin no Sho lists the Mind Body Switch Technique as having a range of up to ten metres.[1] In Naruto chapter 611, Ino Yamanaka uses it from significantly further away.\nIn the anime, it is implied that the user can take over a person's mind without the user removing their consciousness from their body.[10]\nIn the anime, Ino was unable to use this technique on Sora when he was in a version 1 form.[11] The manga later shows her using it successfully against a version 2 Kinkaku.[12]\nIn Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire, Ino uses a different hand seal to perform this technique.\nIn Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles, Ino uses a variation of the technique called \"Mind Reverse Body Technique\" (心逆身の術, Shingyakushin no Jutsu, English TV: Mind-Body Reversal Jutsu), which switches the minds of two separate targets, instead of her own.\nSee Also[]\nLiving Corpse Reincarnation\nSpirit Transformation Technique\nWhite Snake Possession\nPuppet Imitation Technique\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Rin no Sho, page 200\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 72, pages 11-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 42, pages 9-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 332, page 8\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 523, page 8\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 533, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 73, pages 6-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 55, pages 10-12\n\n↑ Boruto episode 88\n\n↑ Boruto episode 140\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 69\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 529, page 16"}

Unlike the Mind Body Switch Technique, the user's consciousness remains within their own body while they use this technique, meaning that it can safely be used even when the user is outnumbered. It is when outnumbered that this technique is most useful, as the user's opponents can be made to kill each other. Because only their bodies are being controlled, targets remain aware of what their body is doing, though they won't understand why. Users can control targets even from a distance, allowing the user to sow confusion among the target and their allies.[1]\n\nTrivia[]\nDespite Inoichi Yamanaka claiming that the Yamanaka can only manipulate one person at a time with their techniques,[2] this technique can freely manipulate multiple bodies simultaneously.\nWhen this technique was used in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 and the later games, Inoichi suddenly appears in front of Ino in order to tell the victim he'll be his opponent.

{"jutsu_name":"Lightning Release: Purple Electricity","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The user shoots a bolt of electricity from their hand to strike a target. It was invented by Kakashi Hatake as a replacement for the Lightning Cutter, which he could no longer safely use after the loss of his Sharingan. In Kakashi Hiden, Kakashi typically uses Purple Electricity to strike targets from a distance, though he does sometimes use it through direct contact, as when he places his hand on spilled alcohol in order to transmit Purple Electricity throughout the surrounding area. He can modulate the intensity of the Purple Electricity, creating a blast strong enough to remove a target's explosive vest but without setting off the explosive or otherwise affecting the target. Conversely, he is later shown using all his chakra to perform a Purple Electricity powerful enough to induce the rain clouds he's falling through to start producing rain.\nPurple Electricity has sometimes been shown used in ways reminiscent of the Lightning Cutter, with the user gathering lightning to their hand and quickly striking targets with it.[2][3] Kakashi could even use it similarly to the Chidori Current, sending bolts of purple lightning all around his body in a omni-directional attack.[4] After mastering Uchiha Style Kenjutsu under Sasuke’s tutelage, Boruto learns to channel his own Purple Electricity through his blade, similar to Chidori Katana.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe term \"shiden\" is part of the idiom \"shiden'issen\" (紫電一閃, literally meaning: violet electricity flash), which refers to a sword flash or a quick brandishing of a sword akin to lightning.\nBefore his manga debut at using it, Boruto was listed as being able to use this jutsu himself.[1] In the anime, Boruto originally used this technique through the Shinobi Gauntlet. Boruto evidently could not use it himself at the time, as it was what tipped off Naruto Uzumaki that Boruto must be using the tool.[6]\nWhile he has yet to use the technique in the anime, Mitsuki is seen using it in the second version of the opening, BAKU.\nSee Also[]\nHell Stab\nPink Lightning\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Boruto Volume 1, Boruto Character Profile\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 21, pages 13-14\n\n↑ Boruto episode 13 \n\n↑ Boruto episode 37\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 6\n\n↑ Boruto episode 61"}

{"jutsu_name":"Lightning Release: Lariat","jutsu_type":"Taijutsu","jutsu_description":"The Lightning Release: Lariat is a powerful taijutsu technique whereby the user charges at their opponent, striking them with a Lariat move, which can be coated in chakra. A successful strike can blow away a target's entire chest with a direct hit, which may not kill them right away, but will ultimately kill them if they are not treated. The attack is rather straightforward, but very quick, powerful and is easily capable of knocking down an opponent.\n\nVariants[]\nWhen Killer B uses this attack, he creates either a chakra cloak or chakra bones, both in the form of bull horns. He refers to this as his \"Eighth\" (八本目, Happonme) sword, next to his seven conventional katana. In Killer B's Version 2, the Lariat gains an increase in power due to the ox-skull he creates. He was able to pierce Samehada while simultaneously blowing away Kisame Hoshigaki's chest.\nWhen A uses it, he surrounds himself with his Lightning Release Chakra Mode, rather than tailed-beast chakra. His high-level chakra, which is comparable to that of a tailed beast's, would produce the same effect as Killer B's version. The two brothers can combine their efforts to perform a Lightning Release: Double Lariat, which is strong enough to decapitate the victim, even without chakra enhancements, due to the brothers' immense physical strength.[3]\nTrivia[]\nThis technique appears to be a signature skill that all Raikage are taught. Also, it is taught to the ninja, usually the Raikage's sibling, who earns the title of \"B\" so as to be a tag-team partner with the Raikage and be able to perform this technique simultaneously on the same target.[4]\nAs with many of the techniques of Kumogakure ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as Rairi Nettō.\nSimilarly to the Fourth Raikage's Liger Bomb, the Lariat is a highly feared move within Puroresu (Japanese professional wrestling). Killer B even shouts \"Wheee!\" when attacking with the Lariat, a nod to pro wrestler Stan Hansen who popularised the Lariat in Japan.\nIn the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, Might Guy's \"Oneself's Rule\" shows him performing what appears to be a regular lariat.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 308\n\n↑ Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Online\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 542, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 541, page 13"}

{"jutsu_name":"Lightning Cutter","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Lightning Cutter is the special name for Kakashi Hatake's Chidori.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Six Paths Application\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nKakashi's Chidori gained the name \"Lightning Cutter\" when he used it to split a bolt of lightning.[2] Although this indicates greater finesse with Kakashi's Lightning Cutter than exists with the standard Chidori, it isn't clear how they differ because they are performed in fundamentally the same way: both concentrate lightning chakra in the hand; both are used to rapidly pierce targets; both cannot be safely used without the Sharingan.[3] When Deidara refers to Sasuke Uchiha's jutsu as Lightning Cutter, Sasuke corrects him and explains that his jutsu is technically only a Chidori.[4]\nLike the Chidori, the Lightning Cutter requires a large amount of chakra to be performed, placing a limit on how many times it can be used per day. In Part I, Kakashi can use it four times per day,[5] which he increases to an unspecified number in Part II. During Part II, Kakashi demonstrates several new uses for the Lightning Cutter, such as forming one in each hand to counteract powerful lightning attacks.[6] On another occasion, he links his Lightning Cutter with one of his shadow clone's, using the arc of electricity to cut through multiple targets.[7] He can also flow it into kunai, enhancing its slicing power and giving him a method of throwing the Lightning Cutter.[8]\n\nSix Paths Application[]\n     Kakashi's Lightning Cutter infused with the Six Paths Power.  \nWhile Kakashi's body is briefly inhabited by the spirit of Obito Uchiha, he applies Six Paths Power to his Lightning Cutter, allowing it to damage Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. He combines this usage with Kamui, causing her counterattacks to pass through him harmlessly.[9]\n\n\nTrivia[]\nAfter losing his Sharingan as a result of Madara Uchiha stealing it during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi no longer uses Lightning Cutter for safety reasons due to being unable to compensate for tunnel vision in his eyes. To counter this, in Kakashi Hiden, Kakashi developed a new signature technique, Lightning Release: Purple Electricity, which functions similarly to Lightning Cutter, albeit can be used safely without the Sharingan.\nThe name Raikiri comes from a story about famous samurai, Tachibana Dōsetsu: Tachibana was in possession of a famous sword called Chidori (千鳥, literally meaning: A Thousand Birds). One day, while taking shelter from the rain under a tree, a bolt of lightning struck him. However, Tachibana used his Chidori to cut the Thunder God inside the lightning bolt, allowing him to survive. After this incident, he renamed his Chidori to Raikiri (雷切, literally meaning: Lightning Cutter).\nIn the anime, the Lightning Cutter is usually depicted as blue, whereas the Chidori is depicted as white.\nIn Kakashi Retsuden, Kakashi encounters Hakubi Shin, a rogue ninja from Konohagakure who claims to be able to use the Lightning Cutter.

{"jutsu_name":"Labyrinth Genjutsu","jutsu_type":"Genjutsu, Scientific Ninja Tool Techniques","jutsu_description":"This is a genjutsu used by Ōga, placing her victims in labyrinth like simulations with puzzles to solve for her experiments, with the assistance of the technology provided by Kara.\n\nUsage[]\n    The test subjects remain in suspended animation in the real world despite their deaths in Ōga's genjutsu.  \nŌga can link herself and the multiple subjects she has captured together in the genjutsu. Ōga can use the genjutsu anyway she sees fit, creating multiple rooms and landscapes, even those that exist in the real world, such as Kara's hideout, with traps and hazards. She can operate as two individuals within the genjutsu; as an older man who guides them through the experiments she had conceived and as a kunoichi named Yatsume that is also one of the subjects to further study the others. \nThose who die within the genjutsu do not die in the real world, but they remain stasis in tanks until the genjutsu ends. There are two ways of ending the genjutsu: the captives must kill Ōga within it or the Illusion scroll that is keeping the genjutsu active must be removed. Should the former be chosen, Ōga would become comatose in the real world. \n\nExperiments[]\nŌga had gathered twenty-one subjects for her experiments. The following various genjutsu experiments test the subjects ability to survive. \n\nNine Lives\nBefore the first experiment, Ōga provided a test for any one of the subjects to participate. She had ten cards, nine are \"death\" while one was \"life\", and if the participant picks the \"life\" card, they live. A Kirigakure shinobi participated in this test, randomly picking a \"death\" card which resulted in him being killed by Ōga.\n\nCollapse\nFor the first experiment, Ōga placed the now twenty subjects on a crumbling platform in the middle of an abyss. The subjects are to reach a higher platform in order to survive. With the help of Kiseru, those who were not shinobi were able to reach it with ladders placed on the top.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nAnaguma\nDropped to his death by Rokuro\n\n\nBatta\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nFugō\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nKakesu\nDropped to her death\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nNamua\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nRokuro\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nShamo\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed Kusagakure shinobi\nProceeded; killed by Rokuro in the intermission for being an undercover Outer\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 1\nDropped to her death\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 2\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 3\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 4\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 1\nDropped to his death\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 2\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 3\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 4\nDropped to his death\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 5\nDropped to his death\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nLight\nIn the second experiment, Ōga warped the remaining subjects in a dark room with candles. The objective is to keep the candles from going out before they reach the goal, otherwise the one whose candle is extinguished will die, with their life force connected to it. The subjects must traverse into a desert with an active sandstorm, which makes it difficult to keep the candles from going out. To extend the flame and prevent their candles from melting, Boruto, Shamo, \"Yatsume\", Kiseru and Namua combined theirs, keeping them all alive. However, Rokuro, Batta and Fūgo, who instructed the latter, claimed theirs from the remaining subjects, stocking up their candles.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nBatta\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nFugō\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nNamua\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nRokuro\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nShamo\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 2\nKilled by Batta\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 3\nCandle extinguished by Rokuro\n\n\nUnnamed female civilian 4\nCandle extinguished\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 2\nCandle extinguished\n\n\nUnnamed male civilian 3\nKilled by Batta\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\nPressure\nIn the third experiment, the subjects are sent to an empty room. There is a red button on one of the walls that needed to be pressed, which revealed spikes concealed in the ceiling. The objective is to find hidden hiding spots for the subjects to hide in to avoid being crushed. However, there is only one concealed spot for the subjects to hide in that is only room for one. Fugō claimed this spot, while Boruto and Batta located a weak point in the room's floor to expose in order for the subjects to hide. There was no casualties in this experiment and everyone proceeded to the next experiment.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nBatta\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nFugō\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nNamua\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nRokuro\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\nShamo\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nProceeded to the next experiment\n\nSum\nIn the fourth experiment, Ōga provided eight red envelopes to the subjects and warped them to a rocky terrain, where they are all separated from each other. Contained within the envelopes are numbers ranging from 1 to 8. The objective is to fight the subjects for their cards in order to have a passing score of 7 or more. Whoever possesses a 7 from the start simply needs to reach the goal without being targeted by others. The subjects must have the required score within two hours or they fail, regardless if they have the required number.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nBatta\nKilled by \"Yatsume\"\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\n\"Killed\" by Kiseru; proceeded to the final experiment\n\n\nFugō\nKilled by \"Yatsume\"\n\n\nKiseru Gankubi\nRevealed as an Outer double agent for Konohagakure; sacrificed himself\n\n\nNamua\nSuccumbed to injuries by Rokuro\n\n\nRokuro\nProceeded to the final experiment\n\n\nShamo\nKilled by Kiseru\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nProceeded to the final experiment\n\nFinal Experiment\nBeing an Anbu working undercover as an Outer for Kara, Kiseru helped Boruto seemingly escape the labyrinth genjutsu. However, Ōga set up one final experiment for the remaining subjects. The goal was to supposedly escape Ōga's lair, which appeared reminiscent to Kara's hideout in the real world. \"Yatsume\" obtained a map and key card from the Kusa Outer that Rokuro killed in the previous genjutsu to help the remaining three navigate the labyrinth. There were also traps within the labyrinth, even puppets of Ōga's male persona. \nWhen Boruto and \"Yatsume\" went further, the latter dropped her disguise and revealed herself as the real Ōga. Impressed with Boruto navigating through all her experiments, Ōga provided the means to end the genjutsu by killing her and removing the Illusion scroll in the real world that kept the genjutsu active for the other subjects. With being given a reason to live by Boruto, they broke out of the genjutsu together and Ōga ended the genjutsu herself for the rest of the subjects.\n\n\n\nSubjects\nOutcome\n\n\nBoruto Uzumaki\nEscaped the genjutsu\n\n\nRokuro\nKilled by Ōga puppet\n\n\n\"Yatsume\"\nRevealed to be Ōga; woken by Boruto in the real world and ended the genjutsu\n\nSee Also[]\nGenjutsu Communication\nEngraved Tsukuyomi\nInfinite Tsukuyomi"}

{"jutsu_name":"Kāma","jutsu_type":"Shinjutsu, Chakra Absorption Techniques, Fūinjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the mark.  For other uses, see Kama (disambiguation).\n\n\n\nKāma (楔) is a seal that serves as a compressed backup of an Ōtsutsuki clan member's biological data that they can embed in the body of a compatible recipient known as a vessel (器, utsuwa). Over time, the Kāma will gradually overwrite the vessel's genetic profile until they transform into a perfect Ōtsutsuki. Should the Ōtsutsuki be slain, their soul will migrate to one of their vessels and become anchored to the world of the living, and when the Kāma completes, will reincarnate (転生, tensei) through their body, completely replacing them.\nIn the interim, the vessel can learn to activate the Kāma and utilise a portion of the Ōtsutsuki's power and abilities, and if reincarnation has not yet been achieved, the soul of the slain Ōtsutsuki can even manifest and temporarily take control over their body.\nCompatibility with an Ōtsutsuki is exceedingly rare and unpredictable, and if an individual is not a suitable recipient, the ritual will typically result in them suffering a fatal seizure. Occasionally, an unsuitable vessel will survive the ritual, however, producing a unique variant of the seal called the White Kāma (白き楔, Shiroki Kāma). Such individuals are unable to serve as a receptacle for the Ōtsutsuki's soul and thus cannot be used for the process of reincarnation, nor can use its absorption power nor space-time ninjutsu, but retain its other traits, gaining tremendous power and even being able to transform into a completely new Ōtsutsuki. Until then, they are not considered true Celestial Beings, as they are not immune from the effects of Omnipotence.\n\nContents\n\n1 Appearance\n2 Known bearers\n\n2.1 Isshiki Ōtsutsuki\n2.2 Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki\n\n\n3 Abilities\n\n3.1 Resonance\n3.2 Manifestation\n3.3 Resurrection\n3.4 Resuscitation\n\n\n4 Drawbacks\n5 Trivia\n6 See Also\n7 References\n\n\nAppearance[]\n    Kāma before being embedded in a vessel's body.  \nThough the Kāma superficially resembles a tattooed seal, it is actually a pyramid-shaped barb that is embedded in the vessel's body. Upon activation the visible marking will spread across the vessel's body, at times taking on different patterns depending on the abilities being used. Typically black, these markings may also shimmer and glow with a particular colour when activated (red in Kawaki's case and blue in Boruto's case), and when viewed up close appear to spread in blue patterns resembling microscopic circuitry. Kāma may produce a variety of different patterns depending on the individual, where on their body it is embedded, and what abilities are being accessed. As its name implies, the White Kāma is white in colour rather than black, and its markings may also shimmer and glow with a particular colour too when activated (grey in Code's case).\n\nKnown bearers[]\nIsshiki Ōtsutsuki[]\nJigen's transformation.Kawaki's transformation.1/2\nJigen: Isshiki embedded his Kāma into Jigen's chin while parasitically fused with his brain, after being betrayed and nearly killed by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. When activated, it spreads across his face and body in nearly symmetrical sunburst patterns. Progressing further, he sprouts a long horn identical to Isshiki's. Despite the Kāma being fully decompressed, Jigen could not manifest Isshiki's Kokugan nor Byakugan. This Kāma served its purpose and vanished when Isshiki was forced to reincarnate through Jigen's body.\nKawaki: Upon realising that Jigen's body would not be able to sustain his chakra, Isshiki transferred his Kāma into Kawaki's left palm through scientific experiments and a ritual conducted with the aid of Amado Sanzu. When activated, it spreads across the left side of his body, forming a pattern that almost perfectly mirrors Boruto's, extending up to his left eye, and then glows red. Progressing further, he sprouts a short horn resembling Isshiki's. He lost this Kāma when Isshiki resurrected via Jigen's body, but later it was secretly reapplied by Amado while restoring Kawaki's right arm, for it to function purely as a weapon after Isshiki's soul vanished. Isshiki's Kāma in Kawaki was estimated to be 80% extracted prior to its removal. By the first battle against Code, the Kāma was advanced enough let Kawaki access Isshiki's raw power and various abilities, including Isshiki's dōjutsu.\nCode: Among Isshiki's previous failed candidates was Code, the only failed vessel of the children Jigen gathered that survived the ritual. As such he bears a White Kāma, which is located on his left palm. As Code is not a vessel, his Kāma did not vanish upon Isshiki's revival into Jigen's body, and before his soul expired, Isshiki entrusted Code with carrying on the Ōtsutsuki's will and bade him to become a complete Ōtsutsuki by sacrificing either Boruto or Kawaki to Ten-Tails and feeding upon the resulting God Tree's chakra fruit.[1] When activated, it spreads grey (light blue in the anime)[2] markings[3] along the left side of its body forming a pattern that almost mirrors Jigen's, extending to the left eye.\n\nMomoshiki Ōtsutsuki[]\n    Boruto's transformation.  \nBoruto Uzumaki: Momoshiki embedded his Kāma into Boruto's right palm as the boy dealt a fatal blow to him using a Parent and Child Rasengan. When activated, it spreads across the right side of his body, forming angular and curving geometric patterns, extending up to his right eye, and then glows blue. Progressing further, he sprouts a horn similar to Momoshiki's and his right eye turns into a Byakugan. Upon facing Code, Momoshiki's Kāma in Boruto had reached 82% extracted. Following Boruto's attempted suicide, Momoshiki used the remaining 18% to revive Boruto to save his soul, cancelling his resurrection through Boruto.\n\nAbilities[]\n    Kāma absorbing ninjutsu.  \nWhen activated, Kāma significantly enhances the user's physical speed, strength, and jutsu power, and allows them to absorb chakra and chakra-based attacks like ninjutsu. These enhanced combat abilities and power exist for the sake of protecting the Kāma's vessel.[4] Kāma can also be used as a medium for Space-Time Ninjutsu, transforming the mark on their palm into a symbol resembling their horn pattern and opening a rift to any location, including foreign dimensions. This ability seems to be rather advanced as only Jigen was able to use it by himself, Boruto and Kawaki's needing to cooperate to use it instead at first.\nIf one properly draws on their Kāma, they can overlay the accumulated Ōtsutsuki combat experience (大筒木の戦闘経験, Ōtsutsuki no sentō keiken) with their mind and body, instantly becoming a seasoned fighter. According to Code, this is the true essence of Kāma and grants the user an exponential increase in battle power, well beyond that conferred by the enhanced physical abilities alone. When accessing this power, ring markings seem to appear around the user's fingers.\nWith enough experience, the user can progress the Kāma to a more powerful state, gaining access to the Ōtsutsuki's unique powers, including their Shinjutsu. In this state the user will begin to undergo a physical transformation, growing horns and awakening their Dōjutsu, generally limited to a single eye. According to Kawaki, knowing that he and Isshiki were alike helped him realise that he could do anything Isshiki was capable of, allowing him to quickly intuit how his abilities worked. Boruto was initially unable to enter this state without Momoshiki taking over his consciousness, but was able to partially access it while affected by Amado's Byakugan-suppressing medication.\n\nResonance[]\nBoruto's and Kawaki's Kāma exhibit resonance (共鳴, kyōmei) when in close proximity. Isshiki and Amado theorised that it was this resonance that allowed both Kawaki's and Boruto's Kāma to mature more rapidly than expected. Although Jigen is able to synchronise with Kawaki's Kāma to open a space-time rift, no such resonance exist between the two of them as Kawaki did not experience the sudden growth until his contact with Boruto. This resonance also often caused Boruto's Kāma to activate involuntarily when Kawaki activated his own.\n\nManifestation[]\n     Kāma taking form of their Ōtsutsuki host.  \nUnder certain circumstances the soul of a deceased Ōtsutsuki anchored to a vessel can possess the vessel's body, using the Kāma to wield the full extent of their power through the vessel. This seems to only be possible after a great deal of time, and typically only occurs when the vessel's chakra has been depleted to the point that they lose consciousness. In order to maintain control in such instances they must attempt to minimise the amount of chakra they absorb to prevent the vessel from awakening. Momoshiki was also able to force aside Boruto's consciousness while he was debilitated by Amado's Byakugan-suppressing medication, allowing him to temporarily manifest without the drawback of limited chakra.\n\nResurrection[]\n     Isshiki revived through Jigen.  \nOver time, the vessel's own genetic information will be completely overwritten by the Ōtsutsuki biological data accumulated in the Kāma, at which point the Kāma will disappear and the Ōtsutsuki will resurrect, taking over the vessel's body and erasing their personality. This is the true purpose of Kāma, and allows the Ōtsutsuki to transcend death. Even if the vessel's body dies and is severely damaged and/or not fully compatible with the Ōtsutsuki, or the Ōtsutsuki is only partially manifested, so long as it exists and still bears Kāma, it will remain viable for the Ōtsutsuki to resurrect through, in which any damage it has suffered will be healed. Despite being reformed virtually identical to how they were in their previous body, the Ōtsutsuki also retains all the memories, skills and knowledge from the vessel.\nWith the aid of technology developed by Amado Sanzu, Isshiki was able to transfer his Kāma to other individuals using Jigen as an intermediary, albeit with a low rate of success, as of fifteen known test subjects, thirteen are confirmed to have died, with Kawaki the only known successful recipient. Amado wants Kawaki to use a similar method to embed a Kāma containing the biological data of his daughter, Akebi Sanzu, into a clone of her in order to facilitate her resurrection.\nAmado noted that there is no known way of removing a Kāma from a vessel, nor to stop its takeover, aside from killing the vessel before the resurrection process completes itself; even the very Ōtsutsuki who placed the seal onto the vessel cannot control the automatic transfer. However, the Kāma's final process of resurrection will not occur so long as the Ōtsutsuki in question is still alive, hence Isshiki was not reborn through Jigen's body despite the Kāma already having extracted all the data into Jigen's body. At the same time, a non-suitable vessel can be used to perform an imperfect resurrection of the Ōtsutsuki. Upon being resurrected, should there be any other Kāma implanted by the same Ōtsutsuki, those additional Kāma will simultaneously be erased. Amado speculates this is a safety feature to prevent duplicate incarnations of the same Ōtsutsuki. However, despite the Kāma's erasure, any Ōtsutsuki data that was already extracted will remain so. Also, White Kāma will not disappear if an Ōtsutsuki resurrects via a complete Kāma. Alternatively, the soul of the Ōtsutsuki can alter the remaining programming of their Kāma to rebuild the vessel's body once, saving their soul but cancelling the resurrection.\nThough untested, Kawaki hypothesises that he and Boruto may be able to produce Kāma of their own, as they have each already had in excess of 80% of their body overwritten by Ōtsutsuki genetic data. If proven true this, could potentially allow Boruto to survive Momoshiki's reincarnation by subsequently reincarnating through a vessel of his own. Kawaki also theorises that Code, bearer of a White Kāma, would be an ideal candidate for Boruto to use as a vessel, as Code proved himself being compatible to survive the process while not being anyone's vessel. Amado claims to be able to restore Kawaki's Kāma, which would restore his access to the Ōtsutsuki powers in his body without the drawback of being taken over by Isshiki, as his soul has vanished.\n\nResuscitation[]\nAs the Kāma also acts as an anchor for the Ōtsutsuki brander's soul to remain in the living realm, should the vessel sustain mortal injuries before the Ōtsutsuki's genetic data finishes extracting, they can choose to rewrite the remaining portion of the data to match that of their vessel and use it to repair their damaged cells and tissues, resuscitating them. As this requires sacrificing a percentage of the compressed data in their Kāma, it makes it impossible for them to fully overwrite the cells of their vessel, and thus unable to complete their resurrection. However, Amado believes it remains possible for the Ōtsutsuki to emerge from time-to-time.\n\nDrawbacks[]\nImparting a Kāma onto a candidate vessel requires a huge amount of energy to do so; when Isshiki was fatally injured by Kaguya, he did not have enough strength to apply one to Jigen at the time. When applying a Kāma normally, it seems to have no detrimental effects on the potential vessel, whether they are compatible or not, as neither Jigen nor Boruto suffer any negative effects nor any apparent pain. However, when Isshiki attempted to place another one while inhabiting Jigen, he and Amado utilised a seemingly different method that involved scientific aid, in which Isshiki would activate the seal from Jigen, and spread it to a recipient, causing them intense pain and, if incompatible, the recipient would most likely die, as thirteen children died this way. It is also possible that a failure be instead be gifted the White Kāma, granting them the pure power of an Ōtsutsuki but not as a receptacle for the soul.\n\n     Isshiki's inadequate vessel crumbling.  \nAs Amado noted, the most important factor of applying Kāma is the selection of the vessel; if an Ōtsutsuki uses an inadequate vessel for a revival, the body will be unable to handle the enormous chakra, and most likely die within a couple of days. Compatibility seems to be rare, as out of the fifteen children Isshiki attempted, Kawaki is the sole success, and Isshiki himself noted how Boruto's affinity with Momoshiki's Kāma to be uncommon. Placing a Kāma onto a clone is ineffective, as the mark will vanish and will not transfer back to the original.\nOnce the Kāma is applied, its process of spreading the biological data into the vessel and the final resurrection initiates automatically, in which not even the caster can control it. When an Ōtsutsuki resurrects, this also causes all Kāma currently existing on other vessels to disappear. This leaves the Ōtsutsuki vulnerable to a permanent death as there is no other vessels to anchor their soul in the living realm and ultimately extinguished, unless they can apply another Kāma, especially if forced by circumstance to resurrect in an imperfect vessel.\nAmado created a drug that weakens the Byakugan. He originally hoped to use it to weaken Isshiki, and theorises that this drug can stall Momoshiki from reincarnating through Boruto, as the Byakugan originates from the Ōtsutsuki, and weakening the kekkei genkai may slow the Kāma that is transforming Boruto's cells. Untested possibilities led Amado believe the drug may require constant intake, that deteriorating eyesight and even death may result, and he warned that Naruto must not allow Hinata nor Himawari take it.[5]\nAn individual who has been given Kāma is viable to serve as a sacrifice for Ten-Tails, as they technically become Ōtsutsuki. It remains dependent on how much of the data is extracted onto the body, as Momoshiki determined that Kawaki was viable due to having 80% of the process completed. However, using such a vessel as a sacrifice will result in the tailed beast blooming into a God Tree of inferior size and a lower quality chakra fruit, as they are not completely Ōtsutsuki. Similarly, even if the data has been fully extracted but the vessel has yet to be reborn as Ōtsutsuki, if said vessel is incompatible with the Kāma to begin with, this will also result in the God Tree's reduced size and ability to produce a fruit.\nUsing Kāma in battle could prove taxing for less skilled users, even more so when they are already weakened, as Kawaki quickly collapsed after using it against Garō as he was already injured from defeating Kara's robots while Boruto was left so badly weakened after using it for the first time that he collapsed and had to be helped to return to Konoha. Additionally, activating it seems to cause a not sufficiently experienced user some pain, as Boruto expressed pain whenever he activates Kāma. Jigen doesn't seem to suffer these weaknesses as he is much more capable at using them than either Boruto or Kawaki, as he never showed any reaction when activating Kāma and using it in his prolonged battle with Naruto and Sasuke had no effect on him. However, one known weakness of the seal that even Jigen seems to suffer from is that incomplete vessels could breakdown from channelling Kāma's full power, as after overpowering Naruto and Sasuke, the blackened section of his body cracked and he even cried soon afterwards and was forced to retreat back to be treated by Amado.\nKāma can only absorb chakra-based substances, hence the wielder is vulnerable to non-chakra matter and energy such as viruses and natural flames. Furthermore, if a chakra-based construct is composited with enough non-chakra matter, Kāma cannot absorb it.[6]\n\nTrivia[]\nThough its furigana reading indicates the pronunciation \"Kāma\" (カーマ), its kanji spelling is given as kusabi (楔), a Japanese tool resembling a wedge or linchpin, and its full appearance when not embedded in a host's body has a similar appearance and function.\n\"Kāma\" means \"wish\", \"desire\", or \"longing\" in Hindu literature, and in Japanese it is also an uncommon way to write \"karma\". The latter is used as its official translation in Western media.\nSarada Uchiha has theorised, due to their similar appearance, that the Strength of a Hundred Seal may be related to it.\nAmado compared the Kāma's function to a sugar cube placed into a cup of coffee: both would slowly spread throughout their vessels, and upon completion, both would dissolve and disappear.\nAny Ōtsutsuki who intends to become a sacrifice for the Ten-Tails to bloom into a God Tree utilises Kāma to prepare a vessel beforehand, for their revival later on.\nAt 80% of data extraction in a vessel from a Kāma, Momoshiki believes this is sufficient to make the target a sacrifice for the Ten-Tails.\nIn the anime, Isshiki had also attempted to apply the Kāma on adults. According to Garō, a chance of survival comes at a cost, as he himself was chosen and survived, but at the cost of his right arm. However, Garō did not gain a White Kāma.\nIn the anime, the first time Momoshiki took over Boruto, he spoke in a mix of his and Boruto's voice.[7][8] The second time, he spoke only in his voice, Boruto's voice only being heard when he began to take back control of his body.[9]\nWhen Momoshiki used the Shadow Clone Technique through his vessel, his Kāma applied to his clone,[10] but when Boruto used the technique Kāma didn't apply to his clones.[11]\nAfter Boruto broke his horn in his second possession by Momoshiki, it became smaller than before in the third.\nSee Also[]\nDark Release: Inhaling Maw\nLiving Corpse Reincarnation\nOrochimaru's Juinjutsu\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 55, pages 18-26\n\n↑ Boruto episode 287\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 62, page 1\n\n↑ Boruto Database: Karmas and Vessels\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 57, pages 15-16\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 64, pages 20-21\n\n↑ Boruto episode 207\n\n↑ Boruto episode 208\n\n↑ Boruto episode 218\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 54, page 21\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 64, page 6"}

For the chapter, see Kotoamatsukami.\n\n\n\nKotoamatsukami is a dōjutsu that casts a powerful yet subtle mind-controlling genjutsu on the target.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Influence\n3 Trivia\n4 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nThe technique allows the user to enter the mind of any individual within their field of view, and manipulate them by giving them phantom experiences, making it seem as if they were doing things of their own free will.[1] It is regarded as a genjutsu of the highest calibre, due to the victim being completely unaware that they are being manipulated.[3]\nAs a testament to its power, it was strong enough to negate Kabuto Yakushi's control over a reincarnated Itachi Uchiha, despite the former's binding being considered near-absolute. After having the crow cast the technique, Itachi noted that the dōjutsu required at least a decade before it could be used again. This period can be drastically reduced through the possession of Hashirama Senju's chakra, even for a non-Uchiha transplantee, as observed by Danzō Shimura's use.[2] However, despite the additional stamina granted by Hashirama's cells, Danzō noted that this technique still can't be used multiple times in a single day.[4]\nNoted as Shisui Uchiha's ultimate technique, it was highly coveted by Danzō, who later stole Shisui's right eye and had it implanted into his own right eye-socket to gain access to this dōjutsu. Later, Shisui entrusted his remaining eye to Itachi Uchiha, who implanted it into the eye-socket of one of his crows. This crow was later forcibly stored inside Naruto Uzumaki and rigged to emerge only in response to confronting Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan. Upon activation, Itachi rigged the eye itself so that the genjutsu would give the order \"protect Konoha\" to whoever was affected by it. Itachi intended this to be used on his brother, in the eventuality that he turned against the village and assumed that he would have transplanted his eyes in order to obtain an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan by then. The technique was instead used on Itachi himself, after being reincarnated and inadvertently using his Mangekyō Sharingan when encountering Naruto during the Fourth Shinobi World War.\n\nInfluence[]\nThe Kotoamatsukami (別天津神, literally meaning: Distinguished Heavenly Gods) are a group of five Shintō gods that appeared at the beginning of the universe. When the Heavens and Earth were created, three of these gods came down from the Takamagahara (高天原, literally meaning: High Heavenly Plains) as so-called 'single gods' (独神, hitorigami): gods that did not appear as a husband-wife duo. These three gods are called the 'Three Gods of Creation' (造化の三神, Zōka no Sanshin) and were:\n\nAme-no-Minakanushi-no-Kami (天之御中主神), the supreme god.\nTakamimusuhi-no-Kami (高御産巣日神), the god of conquest and rule.\nKamimusuhi-no-Kami (神産巣日神), the god of birth.\nAfter them, when the land was formed and sea was rising to the surface, two more gods appeared:\n\nUmashiashikabihikoji-no-Kami (宇摩志阿斯訶備比古遅神)\nAme-no-Tokotachi-no-Kami (天之常立神)\nThese five gods have a special place among the Heavenly Gods (天津神, Amatsukami), hence their name: Distinguished Heavenly Gods (別天津神). After them came the 'Seven Generations of the Age of Gods' (神世七代, Kamiyo Nanayo), the last of which were Izanagi and Izanami, who were responsible for creating the Japanese archipelago.\n\nTrivia[]\nUnlike most Sharingan-based genjutsu, Kotoamatsukami does not seem to require eye contact, as demonstrated by how Danzō cast it on Mifune without apparently removing the bandages that covered his right eye.[3]\nDuring the Five Kage Summit, the Fifth Mizukage commented that she could not help but conclude that there was a connection between this technique and the power that controlled Yagura Karatachi, the Fourth Mizukage.[4]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Fourth Databook, page 252\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 550, pages 10-13\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 459, page 15\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 461, pages 10-11"}

{"jutsu_name":"Kirin","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"Kirin is an extremely powerful Lightning Release technique created by Sasuke Uchiha.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Influences\n3 Trivia\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nSasuke draws natural lightning directly from thunder clouds to supplement the power of his strike and controls it with chakra. Unlike most techniques, which are based on the user's chakra, this one uses the natural lightning, which — as noted by Zetsu — reaches the ground in 1/1000th of a second. However, the preparation time required also decreases the technique's efficiency. If there are no active thunder clouds, the user must create them by using powerful fire techniques to produce the necessary storm conditions. With techniques such as Amaterasu, even stronger storm conditions can be made by them.\nOnce a lightning source has been acquired, shaping and guiding the lightning to the target requires very little chakra. This technique was powerful enough to completely obliterate a small mountain and Itachi Uchiha's Susanoo.\nUsing this technique disperses the thunder clouds, and as such, it can only be used once in a fight. Conversely, however, because of the inextinguishable properties of techniques such as Amaterasu, it can be used to continuously create new thunder clouds to use Kirin once again; however, the process seems to require a bit of time.\n\nInfluences[]\nIn Japanese mythology, the Kirin is considered a holy creature, whose cry is a musical scale and whose footprints are perfect circles. It is very peaceful and careful, capable of walking on water and on grass without bending the blades. It doesn't eat meat either. It only appears in places ruled by a benevolent and wise leader and is well-known for punishing the wicked.\nIn Japan, the Kirin is considered as the most powerful and divine as opposed to the Hōō, the rulers of birds — and is usually placed above all other mythological creatures, including the ryū and Hōō. It can live up to a millennium and wounding one or coming across its corpse is considered a bad omen.\nTrivia[]\nKirin (キリン) is also the Japanese word for \"giraffe\".\nInterestingly, in episode 51 of the Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden anime, when Sasuke uses this technique, a giraffe appears instead of a dragon.\nIn the Ultimate Ninja Storm game series, Sasuke has three chances of hitting the opponent with lightning from the sky, which when hit, will execute Kirin.\nThe word \"Kirin\" (麒麟, Chi: Qílín) actually consists of two kanji where '麒' (ki, Chi: qí) is kanji for male Kirin and '麟' (rin, Chi: lín) is kanji for female Kirin.\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3, Sasuke can use Kirin using his sword.\nIn Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles, Kirin is literally a giant giraffe head that descends from the sky, once to kiss Sasuke to activate his trump card and the second time just to say \"Giraffe\".\nIn chapter 309, when Sasuke was about to kill off Team 7, he took a stance similar to when he is about to use Kirin, but there were no thunderclouds or rain present. This is likely because Kishimoto had yet to design the concept for Kirin.\nIn a 2023 interview with Sasuke Retsuden illustrator Shingo Kimura, Kimura said that Kishimoto told him the art for Kirin was produced using the outline function on his old copy machine to whiten the interiors of his lines, leaving only black outlines. Upon looking at the art, Kimura determined he had repeated the process three times. According to Kimura, Kishimoto replaced his copy machine with a newer model that lacked the function, which is why he didn't draw the technique again.[2]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 247\n\n↑ Shingo Kimura Interview Part 3"}

These transfers are often characterised by a spiralling void that targets swirl into or out of, distorting their form as they move between dimensions. Targets that enter Kamui's dimension are completely untraceable, as not even their chakra can be detected while they're there.[4] Targets that exit Kamui's dimension do so with varying force, either simply appearing at the ejection point[5] or flying from it; if weapons, such as shuriken, are stored in Kamui's dimension, ejecting them forcefully gives Kamui's users an offensive application.[6]\nUsing Kamui is the only known way to travel to and from its dimension. This means that targets transferred there are trapped, forced to stay until Kamui's user lets them leave; Obito sometimes uses genjutsu on those he imprisons to keep them subdued.[5] This also makes Kamui's dimension effective as a refuge, as anyone taking shelter there can only be reached by using Kamui.[7] But because Obito's two Mangekyō Sharingan spend years with different users – Obito himself and Kakashi Hatake – this makes Obito and Kakashi essentially immune to each other's Kamui:[8] although one of them can use Kamui on the other, the other can just use Kamui on themselves to escape.[9] This also means they can block or counter each other's attempts to use Kamui on others.[10]\nObito, while in the Purgatory, was able to use Kamui to temporarily return his soul to Earth to continue assisting Kakashi by granting him the use of his Sharingan for a short time.[11]\n\nRight Eye[]\n     Obito using Kamui to teleport.  \nWith Obito's right Mangekyō, a short-range version of Kamui is used. Obito most often uses this version on himself, sucking himself into his right eye to enter Kamui's dimension and then exiting back to whatever location he pleases. Sometimes he does this in order to escape attacks, other times he does this in order to travel long distances. Obito can perform this teleportation at will and doesn't need to designate his destination beforehand,[4] leading others to label it superior to the Flying Thunder God Technique.[12] Others can be sucked into Kamui's dimension through his eye in addition to or instead of Obito,[13] and in fact it is faster for him to use Kamui on others than on himself.[14] Obito is usually shown making physical contact with those he's using Kamui on,[15] but this isn't always consistent.[16]\n\n     Obito using Kamui to pass through an opponent.  \nThe other application of Obito's right Mangekyō, when activated, allows him to turn his body \"intangible\", automatically transferring body parts that otherwise would have been in contact with the overlapping matter into Kamui dimension.[17] Everything he's touching, including his clothes, weapons and even other people will become intangible too.[15] Obito often uses this ability defensively, making all attacks pass through him harmlessly;[17] during early appearances, while using the \"Tobi\" persona, Obito commonly pretended to be hurt or feel pain to confuse opponents.[18] Alternatively, Obito uses this ability to pass through barriers or other obstacles[12] and extend the reach of his attacks and ambush his enemies by making his Gunbai phase through objects.[10] Obito can even use this ability to travel underground and surprise opponents with attacks from below.[13]\nSince the transfer is done unconsciously, the downside of this technique is that Obito can't physically interact with anything he wasn't in contact with prior to the ability’s activation, forcing him to turn solid if he wishes to engage in combat using taijutsu;[12] however, it's possible to weave chakra and utilise ninjutsu even while slipping through substance.[17] The other weaknesses are that Obito can only keep his body slip through for approximately five minutes and as long as his intangibility is activated, he cannot use Kamui for teleportation; in the brief moment between when he solidifies and when he teleports, Obito is vulnerable.[14] Alternatively, opponents can circumvent his intangibility by transferring themselves or their attacks to Kamui's dimension, which will enable them to damage transported body parts.[17]\nWhile Obito is the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, he is unable to use Kamui to pass through objects.[19]\nObito also had an unspecified way of cancelling Kakashi's usage of the left eye's Kamui when he attempted to decapitate the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, even though he wasn't touching or relatively near the statue.\n\nLeft Eye[]\n     Kamui used at a distance.  \nWith Obito's left Mangekyō, a long-range version of Kamui is used. The user looks at a target and creates a \"barrier space\" around them, with the barrier's size being determined by the user. When the user concentrates, anything within the barrier is pulled towards its centre, transferring the target to Kamui's dimension.[1] When Kakashi first begins using this version of Kamui, he struggles to perform it with any accuracy, frequently missing his target. Even if he does hit his target, he has difficulty making the barrier space large enough to pull the entire target in.[20] In time, he becomes accurate enough to teleport projectiles mid-flight,[21] and later can make the barrier space large enough to teleport the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path's head.[10] Additionally, it's viable to transport only selected body parts to mutilate his enemies, inflicting mortal wounds; defence against this is impossible, except by the right eye counterpart to nullify this. Kakashi eventually learns to create the barrier around himself, allowing him to teleport just as Obito does.[9]\nBecause Kakashi is not an Uchiha, using Kamui demands a great deal of chakra for him to perform.[1] It takes him an extended period of time to gather enough chakra to use it,[10] and once he does he can only use it so many times before his chakra is depleted;[22] originally his limit is three times in a day, but this is later increased to an unspecified number. Similarly, because Kamui is used with a Mangekyō Sharingan, repeated use damages Kakashi's vision, eventually reaching the point where it causes his eyes to bleed.[23] When Kakashi receives chakra from the Nine-Tails, he is able to use Kamui faster, more often, and on targets as large as the Eight-Tails; he estimates that the Nine-Tails' chakra makes Kamui three times more powerful than usual.[24]\nMadara Uchiha takes Obito's Mangekyō from Kakashi so that he can gain access to Kamui's dimension. Unlike with Obito, being the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki does not prevent Madara from using Kamui.[25]\n\nBoth Eyes[]\n     A portal generated by Kamui.  \nWhen both eyes' Kamui are used on the same target, whether by a single user or two users working together, the teleportation speed is doubled.[26] The power of both eyes also grants the user the ability to generate large portals that can allow others to travel through.[27]  While Kamui ordinarily only connects its dimension with the Earth, the user can synchronise Kamui with other space–time ninjutsu, allowing the user to travel to the other ninjutsu's target dimension.[28] Opening portals to those other dimensions requires a great deal of chakra, so much that users will likely need another person's assistance.[29]\n\n     Two Kamui used separately.  \nThe two powers of Kamui can be used separately, even if to achieve a unified purpose: Obito once used the left Kamui to synchronise with Yomotsu Hirasaka, then used the right Kamui to teleport to its associated dimension.[30] With the two Mangekyō, users can also perform Susanoo, through which they can create Kamui Shuriken.[31]\n\nTrivia[]\n\"Kamui\" is the word for a divine being in Ainu mythology, although it is almost never written with kanji in modern times. In a more general Japanese context, Kamui refers to the might and majesty of the gods, particularly the Shintō kami.\nUnlike other Mangekyō Sharingan users, Obito's continuous and general usage of Kamui does not seem to deteriorate his eyesight, and likewise does not tire or strain his body. This possibly stemmed from Obito's access to Hashirama Senju's cells augmenting his body, similar to them reducing Kotoamatsukami's recharge time from 10 years to one day, or extending how long a Sharingan user can keep Izanagi active.\nAlthough teleporting objects from a distance is the left eye's ability, Obito uses the right eye to teleport Kaguya's All-Killing Ash Bones.[32]\nOccasionally, Obito is depicted using Kamui without activating his Mangekyō Sharingan.[33]\nThis was likely done to prevent tension from building regarding Tobi's identity until just before his identity was revealed rather than being an actual ability of Obito's.\nIn the anime, the Hizashi Hyūga of Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook: The Tale of Naruto the Hero uses a technique similar to Kamui.\nThe space-time ninjutsu of Shin Uchiha, Nue, Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki and Sarada Uchiha are similar in function to Kamui.\nIn Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, there are 2 versions of Obito's close-range Kamui: Kamui: Sever (神威・絶, Kamui: Zetsu) for Obito, and Kamui: Bonds (神威・紲, Kamui: Setsu) for Kakashi Hatake (Double Sharingan).\nSee Also[]\nDaikokuten\nŌtsutsuki Teleportation\nSasuke Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu\nShin Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu\nSpace–Time Tunnel\nYomotsu Hirasaka\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Sha no Sho, pages 240-241\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 242\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 510, page 2\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 395, pages 9-10\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 520, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 598, pages 4-6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 666, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 487, page 4\n\n↑ 9.0 9.1 Naruto chapter 608, page 3-7\n\n↑ 10.0 10.1 10.2 10.3 Naruto chapter 595, pages 12-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 688, pages 3-5\n\n↑ 12.0 12.1 12.2 Naruto chapter 502, page 11-12\n\n↑ 13.0 13.1 Naruto chapter 475, pages 10-11\n\n↑ 14.0 14.1 Naruto chapter 510, pages 2-3\n\n↑ 15.0 15.1 Naruto chapter 467, pages 6-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 675, pages 1-2\n\n↑ 17.0 17.1 17.2 17.3 Naruto chapter 597, pages 4-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 357, pages 9-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 643, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 276, pages 4-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 424, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 281, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 598, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 617, pages 3-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 666, pages 13-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 686, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 683, pages 14-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 685, pages 3-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 685, pages 3-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 689, pages 1-2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 686, pages 17-19\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 510, pages 3"}

{"jutsu_name":"Izanami","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Genjutsu, Kinjutsu, Dōjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Izanami is one of the Uchiha clan's ultimate dōjutsu.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Activation Requirement\n3 Effects\n4 Creation\n5 Influence\n6 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nIt is a genjutsu which affects the target through physical sensations shared between them and the user to perform the illusion.[3] Like its counterpart, in exchange for the temporary ability that it grants the user, the Sharingan with which Izanami is cast is rendered blind and loses its light forever. According to Itachi, this technique and Izanagi form a pair, but unlike the latter, which is a technique capable of altering destiny, Izanami is instead one that \"decides\" it.[4]\n\nActivation Requirement[]\n     The mechanics behind the technique.  \nTo begin the technique, after selecting any arbitrary moment, the caster uses their Sharingan to remember the physical sensations both of their body and that of their opponent's during that instant like a photograph (represented as: A). The user must then intentionally replicate the same sensation and in the same way, memorise that instant with their Sharingan (represented as: A'). Izanami overlaps and connects these two identical bodily sensations (A and A'), as well as the flow of time between them, creating an infinite loop of events that entraps the opponent's consciousness. The user can also use their Sharingan to remember multiple sensations, (represented as B, C, and so forth) and those sensations will also be used when Izanami is activated. The user also doesn't need necessarily to replicate A with A' to initiate Izanami. They can also replicate B with B' or C with C' as well. The more sensations they memorise, the better their chances would be to initiate Izanami on a person and the more sensations the victim will experience each time they repeat a loop.[5][6]\n\nEffects[]\nWhilst under the effects of the technique, the target stands motionlessly as the loop of events continually replays inside their mind.[7] Each time a loop is repeated, any physical damage incurred is reset as it were before the start of the loop, although the remains of severed appendages do not disappear.[8] The illusion of the user and anyone they were fighting alongside also have any damage reset as well such as the blindness that comes with Izanami. Despite being able to become consciously aware of their situation and act differently, the victim is unable to significantly alter or escape from the inevitable progression of these events as the illusions they're fighting will also quickly adapt to their changes in order to force the victim to experience the memorised sensations. However, because this technique was created to reprimand and save the users of Izanagi, the victim is able to escape the infinite loop if they can acknowledge the real results of their actions and in doing so, accept their fate.[9] In the anime, it's shown that there is no other way to undo this technique even by someone who has complete control over their chakra. The illusion of the caster also seems to be sentient as the illusionary Itachi was shown to be shaking his head when Kabuto futilely tried to undo the technique without accepting his fate first.[10] The illusion of the user and anyone they're fighting alongside also repeats their verbal actions such as the illusionary Itachi telling the illusionary Sasuke not to leave his side, an action Itachi did to Sasuke. The illusion of the user will continuously tell the victim to take a closer look at them and acknowledge their mistakes until they do so.\n\nCreation[]\nAccording to Itachi, there was a point in time where members of the clan abused the abilities granted by Izanagi, instead simply casting the technique as a means of escaping the undesirable results of their actions. Whilst this resulted in little issue if only one person were using Izanagi, if there were two or more casters, they would begin to fight amongst each other over personally favourable outcomes. Thus, as dōjutsu users were unlikely to succumb to ocular genjutsu, Izanami was created as a method to reprimand such clansmen, as well as save them from their own arrogance. By imprisoning them within an unalterable loop of events, the victim was forced to accept the reality they had created if they ever wished to escape the illusion. However, because of the dangers involved in using a technique with a built-in escape route in a real battle, Izanami became classed as a kinjutsu.[11] As such, Izanami is ironically not a genjutsu to be used on an enemy, but on a friend who has lost their way as a means of helping them find themselves again.\n\nInfluence[]\nLike the various techniques used with the Sharingan, this technique is named after a Shintō goddess. In this case, it is Izanami, who, together with her brother and husband Izanagi, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\nOne of the most famous stories about Izanami tells the tale of how Izanagi goes into Yomi, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve her after she died giving birth to the Shintō fire god, Kagutsuchi. In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape. Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form. Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave. Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day. In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day. In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\nAfter his failed attempt to get Izanami, Izanagi washed himself in a stream. As he cleaned his left eye, Amaterasu was born, as he cleaned his right eye, Tsukuyomi was born, and as he cleaned his nose, Susanoo was born.\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 232\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 581, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 587, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 581, pages 15-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 587, page 2-5\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 338\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 586, pages 14-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 586, page 18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 587, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 337\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 587, pages 3-6"}
{"jutsu_name":"Izanagi","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Genjutsu, Kinjutsu, Dōjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the jutsu. For the chapter, see Izanagi.\n\n\n\nIzanagi is a genjutsu performed with the Sharingan.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Influence\n3 Trivia\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nWith a normal genjutsu, a user will apply an illusion to a target's senses, causing the target to experience things that are not real. With Izanagi, the user applies an illusion to reality itself, giving the user control over what is and is not real for as long as Izanagi is active. Users typically do this in order to protect themselves, negating any injuries they receive or even their deaths. When this happens, their injured self fades away as an illusion and their non-injured self immediately materialises in the previous self's place.[2] In the anime, users are shown extending Izanagi's influence beyond their personal reality, affecting their surroundings and those within it.[3]\nIzanagi is based on the Creation of All Things Technique, used by the Sage of Six Paths to turn imagination into reality. The process is explained to use spiritual energy – which forms the basis of Yin Release – to create shape from nothingness. Then, through the application of physical energy – which forms the basis of Yang Release – the shape has life breathed into it.[4] Members of the Uchiha clan, as descendants of the Sage, perform Izanagi with their Sharingan. In exchange for the brief control over reality that Izanagi grants them, the Sharingan that they perform it with becomes blind;[2] only awakening the Rinnegan restores the eye's vision.[5] Because the Uchiha prized their Sharingan, to lose it in this way prompted them to label it kinjutsu.[6]\nBecause Uchiha only possess half of the Sage's chakra, they can only keep Izanagi active for a few seconds;[2] the exact amount of time depends on the user's power potential.[1] To maximise Izanagi's duration, it is necessary to recreate the Sage's chakra by also having genetic material of the Sage's other descendants, the Senju.[4] Danzō Shimura receives both Uchiha and Senju implants,[7] allowing him to use Izanagi for one minute. As this is still not very long, he has ten Sharingan implanted in his right arm, giving him up to ten minutes' worth of Izanagi with breaks in between as he chooses.[8] Since he is not an Uchiha, each use of Izanagi causes Danzō's chakra to drop significantly.[9] Obito Uchiha, because he has control over the Senju cells he uses, is able to keep a single Izanagi active for significantly longer than Danzō.[10]\nAs with other Sharingan-based techniques, Izanagi can be programmed to activate under certain conditions. Madara Uchiha did so to undo his death after he'd been entombed, restoring him to life unbeknownst to anyone.[11]\n\nInfluence[]\nLike the various techniques used with the Sharingan, this technique is named after a Shintō god. In this case, it is Izanagi, who, together with his sister and wife Izanami, created the islands and other deities of Japan.\nOne of the most famous stories about Izanagi tells the tale of how he goes into Yomi, the Japanese underworld, to retrieve Izanami after she died giving birth to the Shintō fire god, Kagutsuchi. In Yomi, he manages to get Izanami and they both try to leave, however, Izanagi was not supposed to look at her before they escape. Right before they reach the exit, Izanagi looks back and sees her in a decayed form. Frightened, Izanagi flees from Yomi and blocks the cave. Izanami curses Izanagi saying that she will kill 1000 people per day. In response, Izanagi says that 1500 people will be born each day. In another variation of the story, it is stated that Izanami told Izanagi to leave, however, he came back while she slept and lit a fire that revealed her decayed form, prompting him to escape out of fright, and barricade her inside with a giant boulder.\nAfter his failed attempt to get Izanami, he washed himself in a stream. As he cleaned his left eye, Amaterasu was born, as he cleaned his right eye, Tsukuyomi was born, and as he cleaned his nose, Susanoo was born.\n\nTrivia[]\nBecause members of the Uchiha clan previously abused the use of Izanagi, Izanami was created as a way to punish those who would misuse it. Like Izanagi, Izanami also blinds the Sharingan that it is performed with.[12]\nDuring initial depictions of Izanagi, the blindness it causes is represented by the eye's lids closing.[2][4] After the blindness caused by Izanami is depicted as turning the eye a blank white,[12] Izanagi starts being depicted the same way.[11]\nIn the Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm series, Danzō uses this as part of his ultimate technique, letting his Wood Release go out of control, creating a tree that crushes both himself and the opponent, and activating Izanagi at the last moment to escape unharmed.\nDespite Madara using a time-activated Izanagi in the manga, he is not listed as a user of Izanagi in Jin no Sho.[1]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Jin no Sho, page 231\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 Naruto chapter 479, pages 2-4\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 338\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 Naruto chapter 510, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 681, pages 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 478, pages 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 700+7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 479, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 479, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 510, page 12\n\n↑ 11.0 11.1 Naruto chapter 681, pages 13\n\n↑ 12.0 12.1 Naruto chapter 587, pages 4-6"}

Sekiei, a fabrication, was given both the nature transformation and this technique to utilise it in the same way.\n\nTrivia[]\nIt is likely that the mouths on Deidara's palms and chest are the result of using this technique, though Sekiei didn't seem to possess them.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Third Databook, page 105"}

With the opponent trapped, the user is free to attack in person.\nBecause Sasori coats his Iron Sand in his lethal poison, the technique is even deadlier; if one of the spikes so much as scratches the target, it will introduce enough poison into the target's body to kill them.\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 257\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 24"}

{"jutsu_name":"Inner Sakura","jutsu_type":"Taijutsu, Genjutsu, Clone Techniques","jutsu_description":"Inner Sakura (内なるサクラ, Uchi Naru Sakura) broadly refers to a range of techniques performed by Sakura Haruno with her inner self in the Naruto video games.\n\nOverview[]\nInner Sakura is a manifestation of Sakura Haruno's inner emotions, representing Sakura's actual opinion on things when she outwardly displays something completely different. Inner Sakura has the habit of saying \"Shānnarō!\" (しゃーんなろー). The phrase has no literal meaning, but is usually translated as \"Hell yeah!\", \"Hell no!\", or \"Damn it!\", depending on the situation. The English anime translates it as a forceful \"Cha!\" Inner Sakura is unique as it is in a way a second will within Sakura's mind.\nAlthough she appeared quite frequently at the start of the series, Inner Sakura all but disappeared midway through Part I, and rarely appears in Part II. The reason behind this is that she no longer needs to hide her true feelings or reactions behind a fake smile, finally allowing herself to truly say what is on her mind. However, because Inner Sakura usually possessed somewhat violent reactions to things, Sakura is now prone to violent outbursts, which is not helped by her chakra-enhanced strength, making her very scary if one upsets her, similar to her teacher Tsunade.\n\nUsage[]\nDuring the Chūnin Exams, Inner Sakura was strong enough to repel Ino from Sakura's body when she used the Mind Body Switch Technique on her. In many video games, Inner Sakura was made into a technique for Sakura due to her lack of techniques of her own early self in the series. In most appearances, Inner Sakura is a taijutsu where Sakura's inner feelings burst out and she unleashes all her strength on the target with one or more punches. However, Inner Sakura may also interact with Sakura or the opponent(s) as a clone or genjutsu, as shown with the Clone Combo, The Great Sakura, and the Twinkling Maiden's Heart.\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the Naruto: Ultimate Ninja, Kakashi and Sasuke can copy some of Sakura's moves with their Sharingan, showing their inner versions when using attacks like Fairy Tale Get and Clone Combo. Kakashi can also copy Sakura's Cha Barrage in the Clash of Ninja video games, allowing him to unleash his \"Inner Kakashi\" (内なるカカシ, Uchi Naru Kakashi).\nIn the anime, Ino is shown having her own inner version called Inner Ino (内なるいの, Uchi Naru Ino)."}

{"jutsu_name":"Infinite Tsukuyomi","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Mōra, Genjutsu, Dōjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the genjutsu.  For other uses, see Infinite Tsukuyomi (disambiguation).\n\n\n\nThe Infinite Tsukuyomi is an extremely powerful genjutsu that traps the entire world in an illusion, enslaving the human and animal populations in a dream so that their chakra may be drawn upon by the God Tree.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Known Dreams\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nOverview[]\n     Infinite Tsukuyomi cast through the God Tree's blossoming flower.  \nTo cast a genjutsu of this scale, the user's Rinne Sharingan must be reflected off of the moon.[2] The exact method of achieving this varies from user to user: in the anime Kaguya Ōtsutsuki uses Yomotsu Hirasaka to create a portal to a dimension containing a moon;[3] Obito Uchiha produces the Ten-Tails and transforms it into a construct of the God Tree, which has a Rinne Sharingan within the blooming flower at its top;[4] Madara Uchiha, per his Eye of the Moon Plan, flies into the sky and reflects his own Rinne Sharingan off of the moon.[5]\nOnce cast, the penetrating light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi shines across the world, bright enough to dispel the night for as long as it is active. All those who fall under its gaze are trapped in the genjutsu, with the Rinnegan's design appearing in their eyes to represent its influence. Victims of the Infinite Tsukuyomi are rendered immobile so long as they are under its effects, allowing them to easily be wrapped by the bark of the God Tree's roots using God: Nativity of a World of Trees.[6] Over the course of years,[7] humans connected to the tree in this manner are gradually drained of their life energy, personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into White Zetsu[8][9] while at the same time, producing a new Chakra Fruit in the process. The user can also draw upon the chakra of those bound to the tree, causing it to erupt from the ground and enter their own body.[10] In the anime, the technique seemed to need perfecting as Kaguya discovered in her first usage: most of those trapped in Infinite Tsukuyomi such as Haori died after being trapped in the genjutsu instead of being converted into White Zetsu.[11]\nCertain individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The dead, such as those brought back with the Impure World Reincarnation, are impervious to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.[12] White Zetsu, Black Zetsu, and those whose body Black Zetsu coats are also unaffected.[13] However, as seen with Yamato, a foreign soul that has taken over the body of a White Zetsu is still vulnerable to the genjutsu.[14] A Rinnegan user can block the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, saving themselves and those within their range from its control.[13] In fact, Rinnegan users, through the combination with the chakra of the nine tailed beasts, are the only ones capable of ending the Infinite Tsukuyomi and releasing those trapped within its dreams. Should these be possessed by two different people, they must form the rat hand seal together in order to release the technique.[15]\n\nKnown Dreams[]\nThose under the influence of the Infinite Tsukuyomi experience dream worlds where their deepest desires are fulfilled. Only a select few of these dreams have been seen:\n\nHinata Hyūga is in a strong and happy relationship with Naruto Uzumaki. Neji Hyūga is also alive and watching her from afar with Hanabi Hyūga.\nKiba Inuzuka is a Hokage, a position he uses to declare a national holiday for dogs. Also, in the anime, all citizens of the village are to have a dog as a pet/partner.\nShino Aburame discovers and tames a giant new insect species to ride.\nChōji Akimichi has a wife who feeds him and loves him for his appetite. Chōza Akimichi is proud of his son.\nShikamaru Nara decides to never get married to which Temari agrees. Asuma Sarutobi and Shikaku Nara are also alive and enjoying their respective families.\nIno Yamanaka is loved by Sasuke Uchiha and Sai who fight for her affection. Inoichi Yamanaka is alive and proud of his daughter.\nRock Lee wins the love of Sakura Haruno by defeating Naruto and Neji in a fight.\nTenten is a member of a complete and mature Team Guy. In the anime, everyone she knows have polar-opposite personalities and she is a famed weapons master. Furthermore, as Tenten had made direct contact with the Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths just before being caught, she retained her memories of the war and was fully aware that she was inside a dream world.\nMei Terumī gets married, with the other Kage attending the ceremony. In the anime, Chōjūrō and Ao attend her marriage.[16]\nTsunade lives in a Konoha where none of her loved ones died and none of her friends turned against the village while Dan became the Hokage. Furthermore, in the anime, Konoha's peace and prosperity prompts Jiraiya to write a book about it.\nGaara has a happy childhood with his parents, siblings, and uncle and he gets to play with Naruto whenever he wants.\nIn the anime, Yamato becomes the official leader of Team 7 (which includes Sasuke) and is respected throughout Konoha.\nIn the anime, Killer B goes on an adventure with his fellow jinchūriki and their tailed beasts, saving a princess from Akatsuki.\nIn the anime, Karin gets revenge on Zōsui and has Sasuke, who is the Hokage, smile kindly at her again.\nIn the anime, Sai learns to properly express himself again and the entire village comes to admire his smile.\nIn the anime, Kankurō creates the ultimate puppet, which is a giant transforming robot.\nIn the anime, Temari is respected by her siblings so much, they constantly ask for her advice.\nTrivia[]\n\"Mugen\" (夢幻) can also be translated as \"dreams\", \"fantasy\", or \"visions\", which fits the nature of this technique.\nBlack Zetsu revised the Stone Tablet to state that the Infinite Tsukuyomi is the salvation for the Uchiha Clan and the key to world peace, something Madara believed in.[17]\nSasuke referred to this technique as a genjutsu cast by the Rinnegan.[18] In the anime, Black Zetsu also connects the technique to the Rinnegan.[19]\nIn Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie, Obito casts a \"Limited Tsukuyomi\" (限定月読, Gentei Tsukuyomi, literally meaning: Limited Moon Reader) on Naruto and Sakura, sending them to a Genjutsu World housed within a crystal ball. As Akatsuki only has seven tailed beasts at the time, the Rinne Sharingan used has only seven tomoe.\nHagoromo believed that in the past, Kaguya had utilised her Byakugan in some fashion when casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi.[20]\nIn the anime, decades later, Boro would use tales of Infinite Tsukuyomi to persuade many people into joining his cult.[21]\nSee Also[]\nLabyrinth Genjutsu\nEngraved Tsukuyomi\nTsukuyomi\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 295\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 606, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 460\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 646, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 676, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 677\n\n↑ Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 671, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 679, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 679, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 461\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 677, page 16\n\n↑ 13.0 13.1 Naruto chapter 677, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 677, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 692, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 451\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 681, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 678, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 462\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 671, page 9\n\n↑ Boruto episode 199"}

{"jutsu_name":"Iaidō","jutsu_type":"Kenjutsu, Fighting Style","jutsu_description":"The term Iaidō (居合道) refers to a specific style of kenjutsu that is concerned with the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard, striking or cutting an opponent, removing blood from the blade, and then replacing the sword in the scabbard. The linear motion and force applied to draw the sword from the scabbard results in slashes that are faster and stronger than ones executed with the sword already drawn.\nThe speed at which these techniques can be executed — the initial strike in particular — is such, that when performed by a skilled user, it can prevent enemy shinobi from forming hand seals (and thus ninjutsu), by exploiting the small opening that these movements create. This makes them highly effective against most shinobi and potentially, those of even Hanzō's calibre, if performed by someone such as Mifune who has mastered the style.[1]\n\nSee Also[]\nBattōjutsu\nTrivia[]\nIzuna Uchiha's sword skills were shown similar to this style.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 531, page 13"}

Members of the clan's main house brand members of the clan's branch houses with the cursed seal so that, when they die, their Byakugan will be sealed away, preventing its secrets from being learned by enemies. The cursed seal can also be used by the main house to discipline branch house members: if a main house member uses a special hand seal, the branch house member will experience intense pain, discouraging them from disobeying the main house again. If the pain is great enough, it can even kill the branch house member,[1] destroying their brain cells.[3]\n\n     The cursed seal, activated.  \nMembers of the branch house are branded with the cursed seal on the third birthday of the clan's next heir or heiress, regardless of their own age at the time: Neji received his when he was only four years old, when Hinata turned three. Cursed seals are placed on the recipient's forehead, for which reason they tend to keep it covered, such as with their forehead protector. Neji for years struggled with the idea that his cursed seal binds him to a life of servitude to the main house, likening his fate to that of a caged bird; because the cursed seal only disappears at the time of death, dying would be the only way he could be free.[3] Neji's father, Hizashi, struggled with the same view, but took comfort in the fact that he could choose the manner of his own death, the most freeing and significant choice possible.[4]\n\n\nTrivia[]\nThe cursed seal's design (卍) is based on the manji also known as a swastika, a Hindu and Buddhist symbol. Because the inverted form (卐) is commonly associated with Nazism outside of Asia, the anime instead uses an \"X\" for the cursed seal, to avoid confusion. Viz's monthly distribution of the English manga makes the same alteration, but their volume compilations use the original design. Whenever the original design is shown, Viz makes sure to explain that it is not a swastika.\nAo from Kirigakure killed a member of the Hyūga clan to obtain a single Byakugan. It's unclear how he was able to avoid the effects of the juinjutsu, whether his victim was a main house member, or the Byakugan being removed from a branch house member before death, whether the cursed seal prevents this is unknown. Like the Hyūga, Ao takes steps to protect his Byakugan from theft.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Rin no Sho, page 194\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 389\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 102\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 105"}

When the user is struck by a physical attack, the impacted area becomes liquid, causing the attack to pass through them and leave them unharmed. The user then solidifies back into their original form.[1] This technique is generally autonomous, allowing for members to liquefy without conscious thought.\nIn addition to defence, Hōzuki can convert their body into liquid for any number of purposes, such as infiltrating buildings or sneaking up on targets;[1] the anime depicts users camouflaging themselves for the latter purpose.[3] They can pump water into their muscles to increase their strength,[4] shoot water from their fingers as an attack,[5] or use their bodies to douse targets.[2] Despite the versatility of their liquid states, it renders Hōzuki very vulnerable to Lightning Release.[6] If an attack overwhelms a user and they pass out, their unconscious body will take on a jelly-like state.[7] If a Hōzuki is captured and placed inside a sealed container, they will be unable to move or escape.[1]\n\nTrivia[]\n\"Suika\" (水化) is the Japanese term for \"hydration\", but separately, the kanji mean \"water\" (水) and \"to become\" (化) respectively, translating to something more similar to \"hydrification\" (\"to become water\").

Users can take advantage of the surrounding environment to launch themselves into the air,[1] increasing the damage when they fall back to the ground. The speed at which they spin has the added benefit of rendering most attacks ineffective against them.[2] But the ball's speed also makes it difficult to turn, forcing users to stop spinning entirely if they want to make significant changes in direction and thus leaving them vulnerable while they do.[3]\nHow the Human Bullet Tank is used depends on what form the Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique takes. In Part I, when Chōji Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique makes him very round, he retracts his arms, legs, and head into his body so that they don't get in the way while he rolls; because his head is submerged in his bulk, this also makes him immune to external sounds.[3] In Part II, when Chōji's Multi-Size Technique simply makes him large, he folds his legs to his chest and locks his arms around them.[4]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe full name of this technique is Leaf-Style Taijutsu: Human Bullet Tank (木ノ葉流体術・肉弾戦車, Konoha-Ryū Taijutsu: Nikudan Sensha, literally meaning: Tree Leaf-Style Body Technique: Human Bullet Tank).\nIn the anime, Nagare modelled his Assimilation: Rock Tank after this technique.\nNeji uses a similar technique in Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Rin no Sho, page 212\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 70\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 87\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 333"}

The user produces the \"sit\" (座, za) kanji in their palm, and by touching the tailed beast, or its jinchūriki with their hand, the user can suppress the chakra inside an area which is usually lined with ten pillars.[3]\nWhen Yamato used this technique to suppress Naruto Uzumaki's four-tailed form, Naruto needed to be in possession of the First Hokage's Necklace to aid in suppressing the Nine-Tails' chakra.\nWhen Hashirama used it on a tailed beast directly rather than a jinchūriki, he circumvented the use of the pillars and channelled the tailed beast control through his Wood Release: Wood Human Technique, which could even overwrite the control of a tailed beast controlled by the Sharingan.[4]\n\nInfluence[]\n\"Jijun\" (耳順) is a Japanese term used for people in their sixties.

The pictures and poems are intended to illustrate the stages of Zen discipline.\nThey were drawn by a twelfth-century Chinese Zen master called Kuòān (廓庵, Japanese: Kakuan). The tenth poem talks about how the fully-enlightened herdsman returns to the city to help others reach enlightenment. This poem is called Rùchán Chuíshǒu (Mandarin Chinese) (入鄽垂手, Japanese: Nitten Suishu), which can be translated as \"entering society with bliss-bringing hands\" (i.e. hands that teach how to reach enlightenment).\n\nTrivia[]\nIn Shippūden episode 376, when Yamato is performing this technique to suppress Kurama's chakra from leaking out of Naruto, he got motion sickness from riding the ever-shaking palanquin.

The procedure lasts many hours, requiring the constant attention of the medics on staff and,[1] inevitably, requiring backup shifts to replace medics who have tired out.[2] Because of how difficult the procedure is, there is a very low chance of actually saving the patient.[1]\nThe patient is placed in the centre of the floor. A large, complicated technique formula is drawn around them, focused around the injury to be healed.[2] A sample of the patient's cells, such as a lock of their hair, is placed near the injury, to be used as a medium for the procedure. Medics take position around the formula's perimeter, notably the corners, and work together to change the medium's cellular makeup, converting it into whatever cells are required for mending the wound. This is where the technique's greatest difficulty lies, as medics must be careful to form the correct cell and then just as carefully apply it to the regenerating injury.[1]\nIn the anime, Sakura Haruno is shown using this technique by herself; she needs neither the large formula nor the medium. Instead, four formula-lines are used to restore the missing section of the body. The technique is still very chakra-taxing, as Sakura fainted after using almost all of her chakra during the operation.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Tō no Sho, page 247\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 235\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 395"}

As they begin the hand seals, green seals spread across their body, and the user prays to the spectre. The jutsu turns the user into a red gemstone that then fuses with the spectre, turning it into a golem and creating an enormous barrier around its targets. The golem is highly resilient, able to resist chakra-enhanced strikes, and much faster than its size would imply, able to cover distances very quickly. It generally drains chakra indiscriminately from whatever living creature it can reach inside the barrier, which it can use to regenerate any damaged anatomy. If it detects damage to the barrier, it will ignore closer targets to prevent further damage. Its weak spot is the red gemstone, destroying it will both defeat the golem and break the barrier.\n\nSee Also[]\nDead Demon Consuming Seal"}

Sasuke Uchiha remarked that it came close to replicating Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's secret techniques.[1]\nThe seal is comprised of Hashirama Senju's cells and must be surgically implanted into a compatible vessel, a process which drains a great deal of the caster's vitality, shortening their lifespan; Tanuki died right after he cast it onto his daughter. The seal itself acts as a gateway to a separate dimension that Tanuki called the underworld (異界, ikai), wherein dwells a legendary beast named Nue that is born the moment the seal is completed.[2]\nThe mark acts as a medium for absorbed chakra to be transferred into the Nue, nourishing it, as well as a gate through which it can be summoned. It also allows the user to create snake-like creatures out of dark chakra, which can be used in battle or parasitically attached to individuals suffering from negative emotions to continually drain their chakra, further disturbing their mental state. As Nue is fed chakra, the seal's pattern spreads and the beast quickly grows into a gigantic monster, eventually becoming a living chakra bomb that can be summoned to a location and detonated, creating an explosion large enough to destroy an entire city.\nThe principal usage of the Gozu Tennō is to send the host into enemy territory to release Nue, who will rampage as much as possible before detonating to wipe out everything, including the host.\nAs the true source of power for this technique is negative emotions, if the vessel overcomes these emotions the seal will be destroyed. When Sumire Kakei achieved this, a portion of the seal remained and migrated to her palm, allowing her to maintain her symbiotic bond with Nue.\n\nInfluence[]\nThe technique's name comes from Gozu Tennō, a Japanese deity of pestilence.\n\nTrivia[]\nThe strategy of sending Gozu Tennō into enemy territory is similar to how Kirigakure attempted to send Rin Nohara, whom they made into the Jinchūriki of Isobu, into Konohagakure to destroy it. Incidentally, both cases had Konoha as their targets.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Boruto episode 15\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Novel 5"}

{"jutsu_name":"Gentle Fist","jutsu_type":"Hiden, Taijutsu, Fighting Style","jutsu_description":"The Gentle Fist (柔拳, Jūken) is a form of hand-to-hand combat used by members of the Hyūga clan. It inflicts internal damage through attacking the body's Chakra Pathway System, subsequently injuring organs which are closely intertwined with the area of the network which has been struck. To do this, the user surgically injects a certain amount of their own chakra into the opponent's chakra pathway system, causing damage to surrounding organs due to their proximity to the chakra circulatory system. Even the slightest tap can cause severe internal damage, hence the name \"gentle\" fist.\nBy employing the use of the Byakugan, an experienced user[1] can target the tenketsu, thus enhancing the havoc and control a Gentle Fist practitioner can impose upon an opponent's chakra network. These 361 nodes are key gate-keeping interceptions in the chakra circulatory network, thus forcibly opening or sealing them in whatever manner the Gentle Fist user sees fit, is a powerful tactical option to have. The affected person's chakra flow can either be increased or disrupted completely, preventing them from using techniques as seen in Neji's fight with Hinata during the Chūnin Exams, rendering her own Gentle Fist manoeuvres ineffective.\nNeji Hyūga noted that any chakra-based substance can be destroyed by this technique. As seen in his fight with Kidōmaru, it is done by leaking chakra from the chakra openings in one's hands and moulding it into a needle-like shape to slice through the chakra.[2] In the novel, it was shown that one can even use the Gentle Fist to counter enemy technique, carefully cutting an attack two so that it passes by harmlessly.[3] In contrast, Kidōmaru managed to devise a method that prevented the chakra from being injected into the body, thus negating the main impact of the Gentle Fist through physical contact. Because Gentle Fist is mostly taijutsu, some believed users can only emit chakra from their hands due to the hands being the most mobile limbs on the body. However, users can emit chakra from any tenketsu, making binding them with chakra-based substance impossible.\nBeing a close-quarter combat style, Gentle Fist practitioners have a disadvantage against long-range fighters, as Kidōmaru took full advantage of his distance weaponry to overwhelm Neji.\nBecause the chakra pathway system is invisible to the naked eye, the Byakugan is required for most techniques of this style. Since the Byakugan is unique to the Hyūga clan, it has become their signature style of combat. The ability to inflict severe internal trauma with minimal external force, combined with chakra network manipulation, makes the Gentle Fist the most reputable and fearsome taijutsu style known in all of Konohagakure.[4] In contrast to this, the technique can also be used for supplementary purposes displayed when Hinata used the technique to fix Naruto Uzumaki's dislocated shoulder joint during the Fourth Shinobi World War.[5]\nDue to their possession of the Byakugan, the Ōtsutsuki clan also practices this taijutsu form, though far more aggressive than what the Hyūga clan practices. Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki demonstrated his while fighting Naruto Uzumaki, targeting Naruto's tenketsu and internal organs to try to incapacitate him.[6]\n\nTrivia[]\nThis fighting style is based off the real-life Chinese martial arts of Baguazhang (known as \"Hakkeshō\" in Japan), which is made up of circular movements, Wing Chun, which is precise and invasive with strong emphasis in hand strikes, plus Tai Chi, which is fluid and seamless in its maneuvers. This allows the practitioner a wider range of motion and full use of momentum, without giving his or her opponent much of a chance for a direct strike.\nTechniques from this line have also been called \"Gentle Fist Art\" (柔拳法, Jūkenhō/Jūkenpō) or \"Gentle Step\" (柔歩, Jūho). Kenpō is also a popular Japanese term for Chinese martial arts.\nAlthough the supposed reading of \"Gentle Fist Art\" (柔拳法) is \"Jūkenpō\" due to constant-conversion, in the name of this technique according to furigana it is \"Jūkenhō\".\nThis fighting style might have also been based on Touch of Death, in which moves seemingly less lethal can be made lethal by striking certain pressure points on the body, a reference to how this technique targets the Chakra Pathway System and tenketsu of an individual to explosively increase the damage done.\nSasuke Uchiha imitates this style in Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu.\nSee Also[]\nChakra Scalpel\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 79, page 18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 193, page 15\n\n↑ Itachi Shinden: Book of Bright Light\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 79, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 617, pages 12-13\n\n↑ Boruto episode 65"}

For the dōjutsu, see Sharingan.\n\n\n\nGenjutsu: Sharingan broadly refers to a range of genjutsu performed with the Sharingan. It has also been shown to be performed through the Sharingan's higher evolutions: the Mangekyō Sharingan and the Rinnegan.\n\nUsage[]\n     The technique utilised through the Rinnegan.  \nBy establishing eye contact with a target, the Sharingan user traps them within a genjutsu which can be exploited for one of various purposes, such as: causing instantaneous — but temporary — loss of consciousness or paralysis in the target,[2][3] forceful extraction of information,[4][5] relaying memories,[6] erasing memories,[7] removing genjutsu placed on the target by others,[8] and controlling a target's actions.[9][10]\nMembers of the Uchiha clan are particularly famous for using their Sharingan to control the Nine-Tails, so much so that Konoha quickly came to suspect Uchiha involvement in the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack.[11] Sasuke Uchiha is noted to be able to use the technique through his Rinnegan, to trap all the tailed beasts in a genjutsu with a mere glance.[12]\nThe illusions created by Genjutsu: Sharingan do not appear to have any trademark form, appearing vastly different between the same functions and even the same users. For example, Sasuke typically uses it to render targets unconscious, yet on the first occasion the target's body is pierced with large feathers,[13] on another, the target is grasped and overwhelmed by a shadowy figure,[14] and on the third the target experiences Sasuke personally stabbing them.[15]\n\nTrivia[]\nSasuke[16] and Itachi Uchiha[17][18] have both been shown activating their Mangekyō Sharingan to cast genjutsu despite already having their regular Sharingan activated, implying that this technique is enhanced in some way by the evolved dōjutsu, or that there is a similar technique utilised only by the Mangekyō Sharingan.\nA shadowy version of Sasuke's humanoid Susanoo first appears in a genjutsu he creates,[14] only making a formal début several chapters later.\nBy making eye contact with a jinchūriki, Obito could use this technique to control the tailed beast sealed inside them, while its host remained unaffected.[19]\nDespite genjutsu working by altering the chakra flow of a target's cerebral nervous system, this technique affected Mecha-Naruto who doesn't have a brain.[17]\nMadara is shown having to deactivate his Rinnegan to his Mangekyō Sharingan to perform this technique.[20][21] However, this wasn't required in Sasuke's usage.[12]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 318\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 560, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 456, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 408, pages 3-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 510, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 590, page 6\n\n↑ Boruto episode 136\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 585, pages 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 540, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 589, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 501, pages 7-8\n\n↑ 12.0 12.1 Naruto chapter 692\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 413, pages 8-9\n\n↑ 14.0 14.1 Naruto chapter 462, pages 5-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 693, page 6-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 413, pages 7–8\n\n↑ 17.0 17.1 Naruto: Shippūden episode 376\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 455\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 501, pages 7–11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 588, page 8\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 339"}

This allows a sage to achieve incredible feats which include leaping great distances, shattering sharp materials with their bare hands, as well as lifting massive objects. It is said to be a flawless taijutsu that has no openings in either attack or defence.[1]\nWhen using Frog Kata, the natural energy used by the practitioner to create senjutsu chakra also surrounds the user in an aura of that same natural energy. This aura can act as an extension of their body and cannot be seen by anyone other than those who have trained in senjutsu. By utilising the aura, the user can extend the range and force of their physical attacks. Strikes that seemingly or would normally miss will actually make contact with the target. Only users of Sage Mode can see or sense this aura's extension. Nothing else, not even the Rinnegan can see it. One punch has been shown to have enough force to cripple and completely finish off an opponent, not unlike Chakra Enhanced Strength.\nIn addition, the enhanced speed, reflexes and heightened chakra-sensing from Sage Mode, combined with the skilful body movements of Frog Kata, allows the practitioner to not only evade enemy strikes at the last possible moment, but accurately counterattack an opponent.[2]\n\nTrivia[]\nKata is a martial arts term referring to a pattern of defence-and-attack.\nIn the anime, Naruto could use Frog Kata to break a Version 2 chakra cloak.[3]\nIt is a reoccurring theme that Frog Kata is used or given reference to by an enthused Naruto after he successfully lands a nature energy-enhanced Rasengan of some variant.

With such overwhelming numbers, a true \"wall of snakes\" is formed, making defence and evasion meaningless. The enemy can do nothing but become buried by the snakes. The snakes can bite the enemy with their poison fangs and open their mouths to extend Kusanagi-like blades, making them even more deadly. Furthermore, when the inexhaustibly crawling snakes gather together, they become a defensive wall, and can block any kind of attack. \n\nTrivia[]\nMandara is the Japanese pronunciation of the word mandala, a concentric diagram with great spiritual and ritual significance in both Buddhism and Hinduism.

The Gedō Seal: Seal is a juinjutsu that can seal a target's abilities, including the kekkei genkai, causing pain to the target, even when not using their ability. The Gedō Seal: Confusion causes blinding pain in the victim's head, which turns their body into a tool of the technique's caster. When used to fight another, they will feel no pain the victim's opponent has given them, and won't listen to what anyone says. This part of the technique can be cured without the use of a release command, if they defeat their inner self that is in their head. Hiruzen Sarutobi was troubled by the cruel effects of the Outer Path Seal, so he created a cure called the \"Gedō Seal: Release\" (外道ノ印・解, Gedō no In: Kai, literally meaning: Outer Path Seal: Release) which can heal the effects of this technique from the target. Hiruzen Sarutobi then hid the scrolls containing the Outer Path Seal under the Memorial Stone, which he said is to be protected by heroes."}

Though it produces nearly identical results it is technically different enough to be considered an entirely separate technique, and has more limitations.[2]\nBoruto's version harnesses his teleportation ability to translocate to metal objects he previously marked with his chakra, allowing him to freely and instantly move wherever he chooses. Metal objects, including weapons, accessories, and utensils, were chosen as the medium due to their chakra conductivity. The translocation is easier and more accurate when used on objects within visual range, however for objects that are far away the process is more difficult, and if they have similar shapes he may be unable to discern which is which. For this reason he prepared a variety of metal objects with distinct shapes to act as unique symbols that he could visualize in order to accurately translocate to his intended coordinates even over great distances. Some of the objects he has marked include Sasuke's sword, his shuriken, his metal jewelry and pins, and several metal symbols carried by Koji's scout toads.[3]\n\n\nTrivia[]\nAccording to Koji Kashin, it originally would have taken Boruto about six years to develop and hone the technique through trial and error. However, after Koji used his Ten Directions shinjutsu to learn the basic theory behind it, he was able to help accelerate Boruto's training by imparting wisdom gleaned from the future to him. To which, Boruto was able to master it within only about two years of intense training.[4]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 16, page 3\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 16, pages 1-2\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 16, pages 3-6\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 16, page 7"}

{"jutsu_name":"Flying Thunder God Technique","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Space–Time Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the ninjutsu.  For other uses, see Hiraishin.\n\n\n\n\nThe Flying Thunder God Technique is a space–time ninjutsu created by Tobirama Senju.[2] Boruto Uzumaki later developed an imitation of the ninjutsu using the same name.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Trivia\n3 See Also\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[]\n     Minato's formula (left) and Tobirama's formula (right).  \nBefore the Flying Thunder God Technique can be performed, users must first mark a target with their \"technique formula\" (術式, jutsu-shiki).[1] The formula is applied after the merest touch and cannot be removed; it will remain in place even after the user has died.[4] There is no limit to how many targets can be marked with technique formulas, as Minato Namikaze routinely uses dozens at a time.[5]\nBy entering a dimensional void, users can instantly teleport to a technique formula's location whenever they please, regardless of distance,[6] or different dimension.[7] To an onlooker, it may look like the Body Flicker Technique, but the Flying Thunder God actually has more in common with the Summoning Technique.[1] Anything that the user is holding, contacting, or that is linked with their chakra will teleport with them,[8] but this requires additional chakra to do; particularly large objects can require so much chakra as to place a limit on how far away the user is able to teleport.[9] Users can choose to teleport to a different location than the objects,[10] or they can teleport objects without teleporting themselves.[11]\nIn combat situations, the Flying Thunder God can most effectively be used by marking an opponent's body with the technique formula, allowing the user to teleport to them at anytime: when the marked opponent tries to attack, the user can attack them first;[6] when the marked opponent tries to escape, the user can instantly appear at their side.[12] Tō no Sho likens this to a juinjutsu, in that anyone marked with the technique formula is essentially sentenced to death.[1] While trying to find an opportunity to mark opponents, the Flying Thunder God also gives users a defensive option, as they can teleport away from an opponent's attacks. In order to take advantage of this, the technique formula is often applied to projectile weapons, such as Minato's special kunai, which can quickly be scattered around a battlefield to create several teleportation destinations that can be escaped to and subsequently attacked from.[13]\nBoth Tobirama and Minato were famed as the fastest shinobi during their lifetimes.[14] While both were very fast on their own, the Flying Thunder God also contributed to their fame. During the Third Shinobi World War, Minato's extensive usage of the Flying Thunder God led to his moniker as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\":[1] he would randomly appear behind enemy lines and, by seemingly being in many places at once, wipe out whole squadrons before they had time to react.[5] By combining their naturally good reflexes with the instantaneousness of the Flying Thunder God, Tobirama could intercept and redirect a Truth-Seeking Ball mid-detonation[2] and Minato could escape Kamui mid-capture.[15] Minato's ability to dodge A's Lightning Release Chakra Mode led A to dub Minato the fastest ninja who ever lived.[16]\nWhen both Tobirama and Minato are revived during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tobirama was able to link himself with Minato's Flying Thunder God network, allowing him to teleport to the latter's technique formulas.[17] Together, they develop the Flying Thunder God Mutually Instantaneous Revolving Technique, which allows them to switch places with each other in combat to set-up different manoeuvres.[18] During their lives, both developed their own variants of the Flying Thunder God: Tobirama had the Flying Thunder God Slash, which he used to stab opponents the instant he teleported to their side;[19] Minato had Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder, which created a barrier in front of him that teleported incoming attacks to a different location.[20]\nApproximately two decades later, Boruto Uzumaki would take inspiration from his grandfather to devise an imitation of the ninjutsu, in order to more precisely control his inherent Ōtsutsuki teleportation ability. Though it produces nearly identical results it is technically different enough to be considered an entirely separate technique, and has more limitations.[21]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe name Hiraishin is also the phonic of the Japanese word 避雷針, which means \"lightning rod\". This may suggest the reasoning as to why the technique is restricted towards a seal, because lightning is attracted to lightning rods.\nThe Flying Thunder God Technique has sometimes been referred to as the Body Flicker Technique,[4] despite the fact that they are fundamentally different.\nMinato incorporated the Flying Thunder God's mark into his wife's seal, allowing him to immediately come to her aid when needed.[22]\nAlthough it's been said that the technique formula can't be removed, its marking has disappeared from individuals that have tailed beasts sealed into them[23] and extracted from them.[24]\nIn the anime, Minato's technique formula appears to say 忍愛之剣, made up of the kanji for \"endurance\" (忍, nin), \"love\" (愛, ai), \"of\" (之), and \"sword\" (剣, ken). Tobirama's is more reminiscent of the formula used for seals – a random assortment of Kanji, Hindi script, and other symbols.\nIn video games, Minato's use of the Flying Thunder God Technique creates a yellow flash, in reference to his nickname.\nOriginally, before Tobirama's second revival, the Flying Thunder God technique was said to be Minato's original technique,[25] but it was then retconned to him learning it.[26]\nSee Also[]\nAmenotejikara\nClaw Mark\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Tō no Sho, page 266\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 641, pages 2-3\n\n↑ Boruto Database: Flying Raijin Jutsu\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 637, page 15\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 242, pages 4-5\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 543, pages 1-3\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 4, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 639, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 503, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 631, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 673, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 240, pages 8-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 542, pages 13-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 661, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 502, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 541, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 650, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 641, pages 14-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 624, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 502, page 9\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 16, pages 1-2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 501, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 640, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 663, page 3\n\n↑ Tō no Sho, page 149\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 270"}

This also means that even if one is incapacitated, the other remains completely unaffected as neither can truly be regarded as the original. \nBecause the duplicates cannot be dispelled like normal clones, they will be unable to reunite if one is sealed.

It will also drain them of their chakra at a slow but steady rate. Mui uses this technique on the prisoners of the Hōzuki Castle. If the ones who have the seal on them leaves a certain radius from the applier, then it would cause the victims to burst into flames from the inside,[1] burning them to ashes. The user can also ignite the seal at their own free will.\nHowever, for people with high amounts of chakra, such as Naruto, they can still mould chakra and use techniques to a certain extent. The techniques used, however, will be severely hampered, and the seal will cause the user in question intense pain, as though their bodies were on fire; if too much chakra is forced out, the formula will set the victim ablaze.\nIt is possible for an individual to undo the Heavenly Prison placed by another, as Benga undid \"Tsukiyo's\" that was placed by Mujō.[1]\n\nDrawbacks[]\nBeing a fire technique, it cannot work in water, and the victims simply has to submerge themselves in a body of water to use chakra with ease; anyone set aflame by this technique can be saved if water is poured over them. Also, this technique only suppresses normal chakra from within one's body; when enhanced with natural energy gathered externally, one is still able to use chakra. If anyone with the seal applied were able to create a shadow clone, the clone will not bear the seal. The seal will disappear if the user dies.\n\nTrivia[]\nDespite being seemingly bound by the Heavenly Prison, Maroi was able to use Lightning Release: Lightning Signal Fire and Water Release: Archerfish without adverse effects. This may due to Maroi gaining favour of Mui, thus negating the sealing.\nA caster of this technique can place a false seal on the victim, creating only the markings without the effects, as Mujō did on Boruto Uzumaki and Mitsuki, to allow them to enter the prison undercover.[2] This may be what Mui did on Maroi.\nDespite Naruto being branded with this technique, when he transformed into Sage Mode, he was able to leave a great distance from Mui when Gamabunta escaped the castle to rethink their strategy without Naruto bursting into flames.\nThe Ice Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice has been considered to be on par with the Heavenly Prison in terms of restraining prisoners, hence the reason its user was named Mui's successor as Hōzuki Castle's master.\nSee Also[]\nCursed Tongue Eradication Seal\nIce Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice\nPrisoner Cursed Seal\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Boruto episode 146\n\n↑ Boruto episode 141"}

{"jutsu_name":"Explosive Clay","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Hiden, Ninjutsu, Fighting Style","jutsu_description":"Explosive Clay is the characteristic skill of Deidara, first used during his career as a terrorist bomber, and later as a member of Akatsuki.[3]\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n\n1.1 Clay Ranking\n\n\n2 Trivia\n3 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nDeidara holds the belief that \"art\" is the moment in which something that has form is destroyed. In order to pursue this view, as well as to apply it towards combat,[2] he stole a kinjutsu passed down in Iwagakure that allows its user to knead chakra into materials.[4] Deidara feeds clay to one of his body's mouths – most commonly the mouth on his left palm – giving them shape and turning them into explosives. The power and type of explosion is determined by the chakra that he applies to the clay.[2] In Akatsuki Hiden, the quality of the clay is also an important consideration, as inferior clays won't take the exact form that Deidara intends nor will their detonation be as impressive. The white clay used in Ceramic Village for Hanasaki ceramics is the best clay Deidara has found.\nThe explosives are initially palm-sized, making them easy to prepare in advance and then carry into combat.[5] To make practical use of them, however, it is necessary that Deidara enlarge them. This in turn brings the clay creation to life, which Deidara can control remotely depending on how large it was made: an average-sized bird can be sent flying at an opponent as an attack;[6] a large bird can be used as a form of transportation, and once he reaches his destination he can send it flying at an opponent as an attack.[7] To detonate the clay, he makes the Seal of Confrontation and says \"katsu\" (喝).[2]\nBecause Deidara relies on his clay to make his explosives, running out of clay severely limits his options in battle.[8] Low chakra reserves also place Deidara at a disadvantage, as his mouths will struggle to shape the clay into usable forms.[9] Deidara's clay is all earth-based, meaning that opponents can defuse the explosives with Lightning Release.[10]\n\nClay Ranking[]\nDeidara ranks his clay by number, similar in fashion to the Composition C line of explosives:\n\nC1: Deidara's weakest explosive, these most often take the form of birds or insects. They are usually kept at a small size, making them ideal for sneak attacks or other covert operations.[2] C1 is produced using one of the mouths in Deidara's palms.[11]\nC2: a large, flight-capable dragon. Deidara rides atop it while it fires \"smart bombs\", smaller dragons that pursue their targets. The dragon also produces clay mines, which are used to force opponents to fight in a limited space.[2] C2 is produced using both of the mouths in Deidara's palm.[12]\nC3: a roughly human-shaped statue that Deidara drops on targets from above. They are designed to specifically maximise their destructive power, which is supposed to be great enough to destroy an entire village.[2]\nC4: a giant doll, shaped like Deidara himself. When it ruptures, it releases a cloud of microscopic bombs, too small to be seen. When these bombs are inhaled, they flood the victim's bloodstream and detonate, destroying them at a cellular level.[2] C4 is created using Deidara's normal mouth.[13]\nC0: Deidara's \"Ultimate Art\" (究極芸術, Kyūkyoku Geijutsu). Deidara draws in chakra from every corner of his body to turn himself into a bomb. Everything within ten kilometres is destroyed, but Deidara dies in the process. C0 is created using the mouth on Deidara's chest, which is connected directly to his heart.[14]\nTrivia[]\nKatsu (喝) is a type of shout that is used in Zen Buddhism to stop the discursive thoughts of practitioners, potentially helping them achieve an enlightenment experience. It is also used as a means of focusing energy.\nIn the English dub, Deidara's cry of \"katsu\" is omitted with a mere grunt instead.\nNaruto referred to the Explosive Clay as a kinjutsu of Iwagakure.[15]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Shō no Sho, page 10\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 Sha no Sho, pages 244-245\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 359, page 6\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 105\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 248, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 249, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 356, pages 9-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 249, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 361, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 361, pages 13-14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 357, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 357, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 359, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 262\n\n↑ Boruto episode 78"}

Because applying cursed seals in the first place requires a great deal of skill, suppressing one with this technique also requires a great deal of skill. The preparations needed for this technique are quite arduous:[1] users write several long lines of symbols in their own blood, which trail from the cursed seal through the surrounding area. Once this is completed and the technique is activated, the symbols converge towards and surround the cursed seal,[2] the blood acting as a chain that prevents the cursed seal from spreading.[1] Applying the Evil Sealing Method is quite painful, and recipients are likely to pass out after receiving it.[2]\nThe Evil Sealing Method can only suppress cursed seals, not remove them.[1] Its power also relies on the will of the recipient: if the recipient wants it to work, then it will fight off the cursed seal's effects as much as it can; but if the user would rather the cursed seal activated, the Evil Sealing Method will be powerless to prevent it.[2] For this reason, after Kakashi Hatake suppresses Sasuke Uchiha's Cursed Seal of Heaven, Kakashi takes efforts to train Sasuke so that he won't be tempted by the cursed seal's power, notably teaching him the Chidori.[3] This ends up not being enough for Sasuke and he willingly accepts the Cursed Seal of Heaven's influence. Over the following years, the Evil Sealing Method remains imprinted upon him, but inert since Sasuke has no need for it.

For the anime-only kinjutsu used by Kagerō, see Antlion Ninja Arts: Ephemeral. For other uses, see Utakata (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\nThis technique allows Itachi to put his opponent within a genjutsu by using his finger as a medium. This induces the genjutsu. When the technique was used on Naruto Uzumaki, crows flocked from Itachi and turned into shuriken after he performed the ram seal which bombarded Naruto, and then attempted to put him to sleep. When he resisted the sleep command, Naruto then experienced the sensation of his body parts turning into his closest friends who then tortured him psychologically. This is implied to be an extra stage of the genjutsu caused by Itachi after performing the ram seal. The same goes along with his use of shuriken.\n\nTrivia[]\nThis genjutsu is never named in the anime, manga, or manga databooks. It is instead given a name in Naruto Shippūden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! EX. These video game variations only consist of the damage caused by the crow-turned-shuriken, with Itachi finishing his foe off with a sword slash.\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 4, this technique is called \"Genjutsu: Bubbles\".

Neji Hyūga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius. Using their Byakugan's near-360° field of vision, the Hyūga envisions themselves within the centre of an Eight Trigrams symbol. The user then delivers a series of attacks to a target that is within the symbol's perimeter, striking sixty-four of their tenketsu. Those sixty-four tenketsu are subsequently blocked, stopping the flow of chakra within the target's body and making it difficult for them to move.[1] Alternatively, the sixty-four strikes can be split amongst multiple targets, such as to to deflect incoming projectiles.[2]\nThe sixty-four strikes are broken into six smaller sets. Users perform each set of strikes within the same length of time, but because each set has more strikes than the one before it, the set's strikes become increasingly faster. The last set, during which thirty-two strikes are performed, is especially difficult, demanding great resolve and a strong step forward to pull off.[3] As targets are struck, they are increasingly knocked backwards, with the combined force of the final sets being great enough to push them through tree trunks.[4] The six sets of strikes are:\n\nTwo consecutive strikes.\nTwo more consecutive strikes, totalling four.\nFour consecutive strikes, totalling eight.\nEight consecutive strikes, totalling sixteen.\nSixteen consecutive strikes, totalling thirty-two.\nThirty-two consecutive strikes, totalling sixty four.\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, Shira was able to block all sixty-four strikes because of his speed and taijutsu skill.[5]\nSee Also[]\nProtecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Rin no Sho, page 217\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 195\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 633\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 194\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 400"}

{"jutsu_name":"Eight Trigrams Sealing Style","jutsu_type":"Fūinjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Eight Trigrams Sealing Style is a fūinjutsu of the Uzumaki clan.[3]\n\nOverview[]\nA Four Symbols Seal is used to seal a large enemy or an evil spirit into a target, such as an object or a human's body.[4] A stronger seal is created if two Four Symbols Seal are used; this is called the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style. If the Four Symbols Seals do not completely overlap with each other, this allows the enemy/spirit's chakra to merge with whoever they've been sealed into.[1] In the anime, this seal is intended to encourage tailed beasts to aid the jinchūriki they've been sealed within, as the more they provide chakra, the weaker the seal becomes, and thus the better their chance of freedom.[5]\n\n    The sealing altar.  \nMinato Namikaze used the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style to seal the Nine-Tails into his infant son, Naruto Uzumaki. Before Minato performed the seal, he summoned a ceremonial altar that he placed Naruto on.[6] Naruto's seal is located on his abdomen, but only becomes visible when he uses the Nine-Tails' chakra.[7] As an additional safety measure, Minato also sealed the chakra of himself and Naruto's mother, Kushina Uzumaki, into Naruto, who would appear before him under certain circumstances: Minato appears when the Nine-Tails nearly convinces Naruto to remove the seal, stops him from going through with it,[8] and then reinforces the seal;[9] Kushina appears when Naruto is trying to replace the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style with a new seal, and gives him the support he needs to tame the Nine-Tails.[10]\n\n     The Nine-Tails within Naruto's subconscious.  \nWhen Naruto wants to speak to the Nine-Tails, he enters a subconscious plane that resembles an underground complex, with pipes running along the ceiling and various hallways. The floor is flooded with a shallow layer of water; the Nine-Tails' growing influence over Naruto is sometimes depicted as the water level rising. The Nine-Tails itself is separated from the rest of this complex by a large cage; the bars of the cage are far enough apart for Naruto to walk between them,[11] but the Nine-Tails can only fit part of its claws through.[12] The cage's doors are secured by a sheet of parchment with \"seal\" (封) written on it, behind which is the cage's lock.[13] When the Nine-Tails sends its chakra to Naruto, a dark liquid leaks out from the cage towards him.[12]\n\n     Naruto preparing the key to the seal.  \nBecause the seal itself would naturally weaken over time, Minato created a key for it that can strengthen the seal when needed. He inscribed the key on the abdomen of the scroll toad, Gerotora, and sent it to Jiraiya for safekeeping. Jiraiya, believing that Minato wanted Naruto to use the Nine-Tails against some threat, instead uses the key to slightly weaken the seal, giving Naruto greater access to the Nine-Tails' chakra.[14] After this key is passed to Naruto, he uses it to remove the seal in preparation for replacing it with a stronger one.[13]\n\nTrivia[]\nAccording to Killer B, this seal is of higher quality than the Iron Armour Seal.[15]\nIn the manga, after transferring the chakra of Kurama's Yin-half into an incapacitated Naruto Uzumaki, Obito Uchiha was also shown reestablishing this seal.[16]\nIn the anime, Orochimaru suited Mecha-Naruto with this seal in order to take the Nine-Tails from Naruto.[17]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Rin no Sho, page 216\n\n↑ Naruto Collectible Card Game\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 500, page 3\n\n↑ Rin no Sho, page 190\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 327\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 504, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 91, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 439, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 440, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 498, pages 6-7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 293, pages 2-5\n\n↑ 12.0 12.1 Naruto chapter 95, pages 13-16\n\n↑ 13.0 13.1 Naruto chapter 496, pages 10-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 370, pages 7-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 496, page 7\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 666, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 376"}

Neji Hyūga, a member of a branch house, was able to learn this technique through mere observation, a testament to his genius. The moment before the Hyūga is struck by an attack, they emit chakra from all of their body's tenketsu to block it. They then spin rapidly, repelling the attack (and anything else in the vicinity) away and creating a protective shield for as long as they continue to spin.[4] The greater the force of an attack, the greater the force with which it's repelled.[5] The user is capable of defending not only themselves but multiple people.[6]\nRevolving Heaven is meant to compensate for the blindspot of the Hyūga's Byakugan.[7] But in this regard it is quite effective, leading Tenten to describe it as an absolute defence superior to the Shield of Sand.[4] While normally a short-range manoeuvre, with greater skill one can increase both the range and momentum of the rotating chakra shield as Hiashi Hyūga can repel attackers from several feet away and did so with such force that it ploughed the ground around him, cratering the terrain he was on save for the location he was standing at.[8] The only effective means of countering the Revolving Heaven is to prevent the Hyūga from spinning;[9] the anime sometimes depicts it being used without spinning.[10]\n\nTrivia[]\n\"Kaiten\" (回天, literally meaning: revolving heaven) is a term used to refer to turning the tides or fighting back up from a weak position. When written as \"回転\" (kaiten), it means \"revolving\" or \"spinning\".\nIn the anime, Revolving Heaven is shown to reach speeds of at least about 1200 km/h (745.6 mph). If an opponent can exceed this speed in the direction of the rotation, they can breach the defence.[11]\nIn the anime, if the user does not have focus and precise chakra control when the Revolving Heaven is executed, the user will repel themselves out of the technique.[12]\nIn the anime, the Genjutsu World's Hinata Hyūga can use this technique.[13]\nSee Also[]\nProtecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Rin no Sho, page 216\n\n↑ Hyō no Sho, page 29\n\n↑ Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 101, pages 7-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 104, pages 15\n\n↑ Naruto Shippūden Episode 184\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 195, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 137, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 195, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto episode 61\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 377\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 380\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 428"}

{"jutsu_name":"Eight Gates","jutsu_type":"","jutsu_description":"The Eight Gates are eight specific tenketsu along the chakra pathway system.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n\n1.1 Gates\n\n\n2 Trivia\n3 See Also\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nThe Eight Gates exist in order to limit the flow of chakra within an individual's body. Normally, individuals can use no more than 20% of their body's full potential, the brain's way of protecting the individual from harming their body through overexertion. With training, individuals can learn to remove these limiters, referred to as \"opening\" the gates.[2] With each opened gate, individuals are given access to more and more of their body's chakra, thus increasing their physical strength and speed.[1] Ninja able to open the Eight Gates have existed since at least the time of Madara Uchiha.[3] Since Madara's era, there have only been a few known users:\n\nMight Duy learned to open all Eight Gates after twenty years of extensive training.[4]\nMight Guy, Duy's son, was taught how to open all Eight Gates by his father.[4]\nRock Lee, Guy's student, was taught how to open some of the Eight Gates by Guy. During Part I, he's able to open the first five gates.[1] By Part II, he's able to open the sixth gate.[5] By adulthood, Lee had mastered all eight gates.[6]\nIn The Last: Naruto the Movie, Rock Lee and the Suicide Corps could open the Sixth Gate to use a collaboration technique called the Crane Wing Formation.\nIn the anime, Metal Lee, Rock Lee's son, is shown subconsciously opening the first gate.[7]\nKakashi Hatake is seemingly able to open the first gate, as seen when he activates it during a Cliff Climbing Practice.[8] The anime later shows him opening it explicitly.[9]\nLearning to open any of the Eight Gates is apparently very difficult, as Kakashi is surprised when he's told that Lee - only thirteen years old at the time - can open five gates; Kakashi notes that such an accomplishment is impossible through hard work alone. Part of Kakashi's surprise is also because he does not believe it was wise for Guy to teach Lee to open the gates in the first place: although opening the gates does briefly give the user power greater than what they're normally capable of, this increased power causes the user serious harm.[1] At a minimum, the user will be fatigued, which can leave them vulnerable to attack if this occurs during combat.[2] In more extreme cases, muscles can tear and bones can break from the strain, which can be treated with medical ninjutsu.[10] When opening the eighth and final gate, users will die as a consequence, their bodies being unable to survive the immense amounts of chakra flowing through them.[1]\nUsing the Eight Gates is described as a double-edged sword,[1] empowering users by sacrificing their own health and safety; such risks have caused the Eight Gates to be likened to kinjutsu.[11] Because of this, Duy developed a self-rule to dictate when it was acceptable to open any of the Eight Gates, a rule he passed to Guy,[4] and that Guy subsequently passed to Lee: to only open the Eight Gates when protecting something that is precious enough to give one's life.[2] Often this \"precious something\" is a family member,[4] a loved one,[2] or a teammate.[12] Rock Lee has also been known to use the Eight Gates to defend his nindō, the dream by which he leads his life.[13]\n\nGates[]\n    The Eight Gates.  \nWhen opening one of the Eight Gates, users are typically shown opening all preceding gates as well, though it is not clear if this is actually required. To have all of the Eight Gates open at once is known as Eight Gates Released Formation.[4]\n\nThe Gate of Opening (開門, Kaimon), located in the brain's left hemisphere, removes the user's mental inhibitions. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Front Lotus, a technique that tires them afterwards.[1]\nThe Gate of Healing (休門, Kyūmon, English TV: The Gate of Rest), located in the brain's right hemisphere, increases the user's physical strength. This has the added effect of re-energising the body, enabling it to rapidly recover from exhaustion.[1]\nThe Gate of Life (生門, Seimon), located on the spinal cord, turns the user's skin red when opened. Other effects include the user's pupils disappearing, their hair standing on end, and bulging veins all over their body. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Reverse Lotus.[1] In the anime, the chakra released is enough to create a buffer zone to allow safe passage through severe adverse weather.[14]\nThe Gate of Pain (傷門, Shōmon) is located on the spinal cord. Rock Lee opens this gate as he's about to use the Reverse Lotus, seemingly to increase his speed; as he performs the Reverse Lotus, his muscles start to tear. Opening the gate on this occasion also causes Lee's nose to start bleeding.[1]\nThe Gate of Limit (杜門, Tomon, English TV: The Gate of Closing) is located in the abdomen. Rock Lee opens this gate as he's about to deliver the final blow of the Reverse Lotus,[1] seemingly to increase his strength; after completing the Reverse Lotus, Lee's limbs receive compound fractures.[15]\nThe Gate of View (景門 , Keimon, English TV: The Gate of Joy), located in the stomach, increases all the user's abilities.[16] The power that emanates from the user is enough to displace surrounding bodies of water.[12] Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Morning Peacock, wherein the user's punches are so fast that friction with the air produces flames.[16] Opening this gate has sometimes been shown to create an aura around the user;[5] in the anime, the aura is green.\nThe Gate of Wonder (驚門, Kyōmon, English TV: The Gate of Shock), located below the stomach, causes the user's body to secrete a blue sweat. The sweat immediately evaporates, creating an aura around the user that can be mistaken for chakra. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Daytime Tiger, a single punch that creates a pocket of compressed air.[17] After opening this gate, Guy's muscle fibers rupture, causing him intense pain if anyone touches him.[18]\nThe Gate of Death (死門, Shimon) is located at the heart. Users open this gate by puncturing their chest with their thumb in order to direct the chakra there.[4] While open, the user's heart pumps at maximum speed, granting them power a hundred times greater than they are usually capable of, far beyond that of the Five Kage. A \"Steam of Blood\" (血の蒸気, Chi no Jōki) is emitted from the user's pores and hair, resembling a flaming red aura.[5] Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Evening Elephant and Night Guy. The eighth gate causes the body to continually heat up until it's been cooked from the inside-out, reducing the user to ash.[19]\nTrivia[]\n\n\nSpringtime of Youth\n\nThe Springtime of Youth wiki has an article about this topic:\nEight Gates\n\nThe Eight Gates are seemingly based off the real-life display of Hysterical Strength, in which a person pushes well-past their normal physical limits in moments of extreme desperation of life-or-death situations.\nAfter Might Guy opens all Eight Gates, he is saved from death by Naruto Uzumaki's Yin–Yang Release.[19] However, damage done to his leg from using Night Guy leaves him wheelchair-bound for the rest of his life. Despite the handicap, Kakashi Hiden, Konoha Shinden, and the Boruto anime all show Guy continuing his life as a ninja as best as he can.\nIn Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds, Shinnō claims that his Body Revival Technique, combined with Dark Chakra, allows him to open all eight gates without any drawbacks.\nIn Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 and Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3, Neji Hyūga uses Last Resort: Eight Gates Crumbling Attack to specifically block access to the Eight Gates.\nAccording to the official Naruto Twitter account, the manipulation of the Eight Gates is a secret taijutsu of Konohagakure.[20][21]\nSee Also[]\nAntlion Ninja Arts: Ephemeral\nPressure Points of Harm and Death\nSeven Heavens Breathing Method\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 Naruto chapter 85\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 Naruto chapter 52\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 667\n\n↑ 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 Naruto chapter 668\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 Naruto chapter 669\n\n↑ Boruto episode 70\n\n↑ Boruto episode 70\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 93, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 87\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 237\n\n↑ 12.0 12.1 Naruto chapter 258\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 83\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 411\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 84\n\n↑ 16.0 16.1 Sha no Sho, page 224\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 507\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 512\n\n↑ 19.0 19.1 Naruto chapter 672, pages 15-17\n\n↑ https://twitter.com/NARUTO_info_en/status/1827767902923317638\n\n↑ https://twitter.com/NARUTO_kousiki/status/1827888698228125941"}

This technique transcends the \"Snake\", and becomes like a \"Dragon God\".[1]\nWhen using this technique, Orochimaru can emerge from the mouth of one of the heads and use his Sword of Kusanagi to attack.\n\nTrivia[]\nThe name of this technique comes from the legendary snake Yamata no Orochi, a  monstrous eight-headed and eight-tailed snake that was destroyed by the god Susanoo-no-Mikoto. This is referenced when Itachi's Susanoo killed the serpents produced by this technique.\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, the eight snakes' heads can unite to create a devastating energy attack similar to a Tailed Beast Ball from a tailed beast that was powerful enough to overwhelm the defences of Itachi's armoured Susanoo, even with it using its Yata Mirror for defence.\nDespite the fact that this technique was stated to be the product of Orochimaru's years of human experimentation and the Living Corpse Reincarnation technique in the manga,[1] in the anime, it was stated that Orochimaru, upon defecting from Konohagakure, stole the scroll from the Hokage Residence with the information on this kinjutsu.[2]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Sha no Sho, pages 310-311\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 114"}

Users are not limited to strictly defensive uses for this technique, as they can create walls behind targets to prevent them from escaping[4] or even to entirely surround and encase said targets.[5] The anime shows users creating these walls from afar.[6]\nIn Kakashi Retsuden, the Earth-Style Wall is one of several techniques that Kakashi specifically improves his ability with after the Fourth Shinobi World War, to make up for the loss of his Sharingan.

They are fairly easy to destroy. If the technique is deactivated either by the user's will or if the user is killed, the zombies will immediately turn to dust.\nThe second version allows the user to bring a person back as a perfect resurrection, able to use all their skills from when they were alive, with the addition of a preset directive the person is forced to obey despite being consciously aware. Unlike the Impure World Reincarnation technique, the soul is not bound to the body, hence those resurrected cannot heal themselves and can be killed. This method requires a large amount of energy (i.e. electricity). At any time, by performing a Snake hand seal and snapping their fingers, the caster of this technique releases the resurrected targets, turning them into loose soil.\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto Collectible Card Game"}

{"jutsu_name":"Earth Grudge Fear","jutsu_type":"Hiden, Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Earth Grudge Fear is a secret kinjutsu of Takigakure which transforms the user's body into something similar to that of a rag-doll, held together by hundreds of thick black threads. \n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Masks\n3 Trivia\n4 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nKakuzu, who stole the knowledge of this technique before his defection from Takigakure,[2] was able to manipulate black threads for many purposes. He was capable of sewing up any injuries that he or others might suffer, commonly by reattaching body parts; this ability seems to instantly reattach even nerves and muscles, as the patients could instantly move their limbs without any other complex procedures right away. However, it appears that this ability is somewhat limited, as he warned Hidan not to move his head too much after he had sewed it back on, saying that it might fall off again. He could detach parts of his limbs and then manipulate them, to the point that he could even send them underground and then reattach them when he was done with them.\nThe most significant aspect of these threads is that they granted Kakuzu a form of immortality, although he declined to think of it that way. In addition to sewing up his injuries, he could use the threads to tear into a victim's body, steal their still functioning organs, and integrate them into his own body, thus extending his life. Kakuzu usually used this method to steal hearts from powerful shinobi, and was able to store up to four spare hearts in his body at any given time, meaning that all hearts must stop functioning in order for Kakuzu to die. He can also put one of those hearts into his limbs and have them move individually, as seen when he used his hand to remove a shadow-enhanced  chakra blades that prevented the rest of his body from moving.\n\nMasks[]\n     Kakuzu with his heart constructs.  \nThe extra hearts in Kakuzu's body are normally stored in various animal masks that were sewn onto his back, granting him vast amounts of chakra and numerous elemental affinities. He could detach these masks and have them take on a body of their own, composed entirely of threads. Ino Yamanaka commented the masks gave off a bad chakra.[3] These masks were capable of attacking separately, unleashing devastating blasts of elemental chakra. These threads could also compact together to form a spider-like body around Kakuzu, allowing him to fuse the attacks of his masks together in order to increase his attacking power.\n\n     Kakuzu's masks: water (top-left), fire (top-right), lightning (bottom-left), and wind (bottom-right).  \nKakuzu's animal masks contained his spare hearts. If he took use of the heart for himself, the corresponding mask would shatter upon the creature's reentry into Kakuzu's body.\n\nFire mask: This heart had a fire-affinity, and took on the shape of a demonic tiger. It could use Fire Release: Intelligent Hard Work. This mask could also unite with the Wind mask to launch a fire-wind dual strike that was near unstoppable.\nLightning  mask: This heart had a lightning-affinity, and took on the shape of some sort of deformed bipedal. It could use Lightning Release: False Darkness.\nWater mask:[4] This heart had an water-affinity, and took on the shape of a demonic, beaked bipedal.[5] It allowed Kakuzu to use Water Release techniques, although they were not seen as the mask was destroyed before Kakuzu could use any.\nWind mask: This heart had a wind-affinity, and took on a strange four-legged body with thin wings. It could use Wind Release: Pressure Damage. It could unite with the Fire mask to launch a fire-wind dual strike that was near unstoppable.\nTrivia[]\nLike the rest of Kakuzu's techniques, the name of this techniques comes from the mecha anime Mobile Suit Gundam (機動戦士ガンダム, Kidō Senshi Gandamu). The name Jiongu was taken from the Mobile Suit MSN-02 Zeong (ジオング, Jiongu), a mecha that can detach its arms for ranged attacks, while still attached to the main body with wires. The name was altered slightly and given kanji to create the name of this technique.\nIn the manga, when Kakuzu is explaining his ability to store hearts, he is seen with a single horned mask on his back not matching the design of any of other masks.[6] The colour and element of this mask is unknown.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 263\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, pages 56-59\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 334, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Impact\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 528, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 336, page 5, panel 1"}

The structure expands rapidly in size when being propelled towards its intended target and traps them inside its confines. The sphere then seems to explode with a tremendous amount of force, while the exterior walls of the structure effectively restrict the size of the blast radius, resulting in the destruction of everything and anyone caught within as they are pulverised into minute particles of dust. Because it attacks at a molecular level, there is no conventional defence against this technique.[1] The technique isn't limited to just affecting physical matter; it can also affect chakra-based defences, witnessed from Ōnoki's use of it to destroy Madara Uchiha's Susanoo.[2]\n\n     Kakō's large variant.  \nThe resulting damage that this technique can produce varies considerably, depending on the initial shape of the created structure. For example, when fabricated in the form of a cube, the structure possesses a relatively small blast radius, minimising the possibility for collateral damage. However, the conical version was implied to be enough to potentially destroy an entire island.[3] Additionally, it is possible to produce a much larger variant of the cube-shaped technique, which was large enough to destroy twenty-five Susanoo-clad wood clones in an instant. This cube can also be split into two after being activated, allowing for other techniques to be directed between the two halves.[4] When two similar techniques of approximately equal power collide, the pair merge into a single large spherical explosion; where everything caught within the substantial blast radius is completely pulverised.[5]\nKakō has shown he could fire off the cubical version of the technique one-handed, which allows him for a rapid-fire attack (albeit the cubes do not expand upon release).[6]\n\nShape Variants[]\nThis technique can be manipulated into a diverse selection of three-dimensional structures, including cones, cylinders and cubes, with each retaining a sphere located at their centres. The size and length of it is proportional to the amount of chakra put into it. According to Ōnoki, the differences in shape demonstrated by the users of this technique is reflective of the generational gap between them.[5]\n\nCubical variant.Drill (錐, Kiri)[7] variant.Cylinder (柱, Chū)[7] variant.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Fourth Databook, page 259\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 575, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 514, pages 1-2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 588, pages 14-15\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 546, pages 14-16\n\n↑ Boruto episode 87\n\n↑ 7.0 7.1 Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution"}

{"jutsu_name":"Dharma Power Sealing Technique: Sen no Rikyū","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Fūinjutsu, Chakra Absorption Techniques","jutsu_description":"With the help of a musical instrument and a fūinjutsu formula on their chest, the user produces a stream of chakra that forms into many purple-coloured chains that are launched from the formula into the target. The chains move very fast, able to bypass Gaara's Shield of Sand, which is known for its speed. Once latched on to the target's body and chakra network, the chains will use the tenketsu located at the navel to reach their way to the tailed beast and constrict their neck, pulling the beast from the inside of the jinchūriki. The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinchūriki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinchūriki's immobilisation and causing them pain. Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock. However, if another jinchūriki touches the chains, then their chakra will be drained for the duration of the physical contact.\nThe technique can be countered. Techniques that suppress chakra absorption such as a cocoon made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained. The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by closing the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.\nThere is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however. If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them. Despite that, the seal can be broken if all tenketsu of the target are blocked, after which they will still be in need for immediate treatment.\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique is most likely named after a Japanese historical figure, known as Sen no Rikyū.\nSee Also[]\nAdamantine Sealing Chains\nDemonic Statue Chains"}

He implanted a single receiver into each of his Six Paths of Pain, which were made into temporary jinchūriki. By manifesting chains from the jinchūriki's receivers and connecting them to his hand, he was able to bind and suppress the tailed beasts inside them in the event that they resisted his control.[5] When Naruto Uzumaki was trapped inside the Four-Tails' mouth, Obito attempted to capture him by dragging the beast inside his own body using these chains.[6] The beasts were also bound by chains within their consciousness; when the receivers were removed from their jinchūriki's bodies, these chains were replaced by a single larger chain connecting directly to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, permitting Obito to quickly reseal them into the statue.[7]\n\n     The Demonic Statue emitting chains.  \nThe Demonic Statue itself is able to emit chakra chains from its mouth.

Haku creates several large mirrors out of ice, which he surrounds a target with.[1] By entering one of these mirrors,[2] Haku's reflection will appear in all of them. Haku can travel between these mirrors near-instantaneously, giving the appearance that he occupies all of them simultaneously. As such, any attacks he makes from these mirrors - usually rapid volleys of thrown senbon - can overwhelm opponents, seemingly coming from every mirror at once.[1] Using the technique requires a great deal of chakra from Haku, meaning he cannot use it indefinitely.[3] In the anime, if the mirror the user is in is broken, they can leap out of one of the fragments and continue their attack or move to another mirror.[4]\nAlthough Haku moves between the mirrors extremely quickly, to the point that Rin no Sho describes it as light speed,[1] it is still possible to track him: Sasuke Uchiha, with his undeveloped Sharingan, becomes able to follow his movements, and with enough time could even attack Haku;[3] Naruto Uzumaki, after entering an initial jinchūriki form, is able to dodge Haku as well.[5] Similarly, although the mirrors are quite resilient, notably not melting against standard Fire Release,[6] Naruto's jinchūriki form is strong enough to shatter one.[5] The mirrors will also shatter if Haku stops maintaining them.[7]\nThese exceptions aside, the Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals is still a formidable technique. Most victims will be unable to do anything against Haku's attacks, as they are so fast and come from so many directions at once that it's impossible to see all of them. If they should try to attack Haku while he's within a mirror, he can simply move to another mirror before they've even noticed.[1] If Haku completely surrounds his victims with mirrors, such as the dome he uses against Sasuke, then they are effectively trapped; only allies working from outside the dome stand a reasonable chance of saving them.[6] Even targets who manage to keep their distance from Haku are not safe, as he can simply form a mirror next to them, allowing him to quickly travel to and attack them.[8]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe full name of this technique is \"Secret Technique: Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals\" (秘術・魔鏡氷晶, Hijutsu: Makyō Hyōshō).\nThe technique specific seal for this jutsu closely resembles the hand seal for the real life Kuji-in seal of Pyō (兵) which has the middle fingers hooked over the index fingers and touching, the only difference being that the remaining four fingers are curled inward with the fingernails not showing.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Rin no Sho, page 221\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 24\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 27, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto episode 17\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 28\n\n↑ 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 25\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 524\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 521, pages 11-12"}

It allows the user to put their opponent under an illusion using only words and speech. By infusing chakra into the tongue of the user, any target within auditory range of the user will become easily swayed in a post-hypnotic trance of their will and self-assurance; forcing them to face their innermost trauma as realised by the user's words in an effort to mentally break their spirit. Once told to look behind their back the genjutsu becomes complete, causing them to awaken (覚醒, Kakusei) as an obedient follower of the user.\nThe illusion itself cannot be easily broken, even when the person is under realisation that the genjutsu is in effect, but strong emotional connections, like love, can help in dispelling it. Hearing also plays a major factor for the illusion to take effect; as hearing loss makes the target immune to the genjutsu entirely. Likewise, echoes and acoustics that enhance the user's voice can make the genjutsu more effective to sway the target.\n\nTrivia[]\nWhile not named in the anime or the novel, the technique was given a proper name in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing.\nKankurō indirectly references this from Gaara's Tale DLC in Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4."}

If any of his targets should somehow avoid this technique, Kimimaro, by activating the second level of his cursed seal, is able to merge with the bone blades.

Orochimaru was able to briefly reactivate the seal when they fought in the Forest of Death before the Third Hokage sealed it off again. It was fully removed when Sasuke used it as a medium to revive Orochimaru's consciousness and body via the Evil Releasing Method.[2]\n\n     Sasuke receives curse seal.  \nOrochimaru branded Sasuke with the cursed seal in the second phase of the Chūnin Exams, which took place in the Forest of Death. Orochimaru intended to have the seal corrode Sasuke's mind so that he could become his next body. Kakashi Hatake used the Evil Sealing Method to try and prevent this, but its effectiveness relied on Sasuke's choosing not to use his cursed seal. Sasuke ultimately chose to advance his seal to its second level, and went to Orochimaru with the help of the Sound Four. \nWhen Sasuke activated the second level of the seal, his skin turned dark-grey and his hair grew and turned dark blue. His eyes also turned dark grey. Additionally, he grew webbed-claw-shaped wings from his back which he could use to fly and glide, and a dark, star-shaped mark appeared across the bridge of his nose. Should any limbs be lost, Sasuke is able to replace them with snakes. During Sasuke's battle with Itachi Uchiha, he lost the cursed seal, along with Orochimaru (having earlier been absorbed into Sasuke's body), as they were removed with the Sword of Totsuka.\nAccording to Kabuto, the seal itself contains Orochimaru's chakra, which Kabuto used in order to improve the binding power of Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation. In fact, when Orochimaru was defeated, his consciousness remained split amongst the cursed seals, and Sasuke used that, along with a piece of Kabuto's modified flesh, to bring the former back to his original state and mind.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 199, pages 2-3\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 593, page 9"}
{"jutsu_name":"Cursed Seal of Earth","jutsu_type":"Juinjutsu, Kinjutsu, Senjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Cursed Seal of Earth is one of the strongest of Orochimaru's cursed seals, the other being its counterpart: the Cursed Seal of Heaven. \n\nAppearance[]\nIt consists of three slightly curved lines, which spread in a rip-like pattern. The seal is located on the upper portion of Kimimaro's chest over his manubrium. When the first level is activated, the seal turns orange-red and expands in lines spreading all over Kimimaro's body in contorting and parallel lines. When the second level of the seal is active, Kimimaro takes on a dinosaur-like appearance complete with a tail. Several large bones also protrude from his darkened skin and gains four distinguishing figures: two dark black curved like markings under his eyes - one under each eye and two as elongated eyebrows - one above each eye.\n\nUsage[]\nThis cursed seal is particularly strong even amongst the other already powerful cursed seals with Kimimaro being the only known user and with the Cursed Seal of Heaven standing as its only equal. Like all cursed seals, Kimimaro receives increased chakra levels, physical capabilities and his ninjutsu skills become more effective when the seal is active. The second level also increases his healing might, as his torn flesh was instantly restored upon his transformation.\nKimimaro must enter his second level in order to properly use the Dance of the Clematis: Flower, due to the resultant weapon's size and density.[1] In his second level, he can also merge with the bone blades created by his Dance of the Seedling Fern, allowing him to launch a deadly surprise attack at his target's blindspot.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Tō no Sho, page 257\n\n↑ Tō no Sho, page 227"}

The other being him to acquire and ingest the blood of his intended victim. Once ingested, his skin then turns black with white markings which makes him look like a skeleton, a symbol of absolute death. This serves as the link between him and his victim. \nOnce his sacrificial ritual takes place, the victim's body is linked with Hidan's curse until he either steps or is forced out of the circle. Any kind of injury that Hidan inflicts upon himself (or the injury they inflicted on him) is reciprocated on his target, be it a mere scratch to a pierce in the heart. If Hidan is forced to step out of the circle, the link is temporarily broken and the victim is set free, but only as long as Hidan has stepped out of the circle's reach. Basically, this technique makes Hidan a living voodoo doll.\n\nTrivia[]\nHidan's immortality is due to the \"successful experiment of the Jashin religion's secret technique\", so he can fatally torture his opponents in any way he desires without killing himself, and he clearly enjoys the pain as well. However, he does indeed complain that it hurts like one normally does in pain, after he finished off Asuma.\nSee Also[]\nFūma clan's Chakra Threads\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 267"}

When the cage breaks, a massive explosion of energy follows, destroying a wide area and harming the user. The prisoner however, remains safe at the centre of the blast.\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique is somewhat similar in appearance and mechanics to Dust Release techniques, as both allow users to manipulate the size of a geometric 3-dimensional shape composed of energy/chakra by altering the distance between their palms.

After seeing Kakashi bearing the Sharingan, Hiruko uses the technique to integrate the bodies of others with his own, allowing him to obtain any kekkei genkai they possess, as well as physicality, other special traits, and absorb their chakra. The technique is also used by Hiruko and his followers to create formidable creatures which bear the traits of multiple animals. Hiruko has used this technique to steal four kekkei genkai: Storm, Dark, Steel, and Swift Releases.\n\nOverview[]\nThe maximum number of kekkei genkai that the Chimera Technique can absorb alone is four, which even so is an incomplete absorption, and requires certain conditions to acquire the fifth, as well as fully absorb the previous four. These are the three conditions: \"Heaven,\" \"Earth,\" and \"Human.\" These correspond with the solar eclipse, Mount Shumisen and the five kekkei genkai-bearing human sacrifices, respectively. It's likely that more kekkei genkai can be absorbed after achieving the conditions listed above. When assimilating victims, Hiruko's body exudes a large mass of deep blue, viscous fluid that covers a large area. While assimilating victims, he can use the fluid to attack enemies with gelatinous, reforming (and rebounding) extensions. Once the five bodies have been completely absorbed, the person will have immortality and mastery over the five elements.\nIt should be noted that the technique can be stopped from the inside out by using a dimension-manipulating technique such as Kamui. Additionally, the technique requires body modification, due to the body requiring space for the user to assimilate targets, as seen by the large scars and staples in Hiruko's chest and sides, and leaves his body rather emaciated, with a larger, unhinged jaw and shrivelled teeth. The hollowed body space can also be a potential weak spot until it is filled by the assimilated victim.\nWhile Hiruko's main usage of this technique is to merge others into himself to gain kekkei genkai, his subordinates had used it to merge several creatures into chimeric creatures modified with powerful abilities, such as a pair of dogs with launchers and a bird that can rain explosive feathers. They also use the technique to merge with the creatures to increase their own combat efficiency: Ichi has used this technique to merge with the snake he summons, Ni used it to merge with her lion-like beast, and San was able to use it to merge with Ichi and Ni, becoming a chimera beast that Hiruko summoned later to deal with the Konoha 11. The beast San created bears Ichi's snakes as its tails, Ni's beast's flamethrower breath and lion face, and San's bird's wings, with its \"face\" on the beast's back near the wings.\n\nInfluence[]\nA chimera is a mythological creature composed of the parts of multiple animals, and is also a genetic term for hybrid animals with more than one DNA pattern. This is likely a reference to the fact that Hiruko developed the technique as a way to adopt the genetically inherited abilities of other shinobi, regardless of his own bloodline.\n\nTrivia[]\nThe technique's name is a pun, similar to certain techniques of Kumogakure-ninja, in which it has an English name with a given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation.\nDuring the movie, Hiruko can use the kekkei genkai without needing to assimilate the victims completely, but in order to gain full access to those powers, as well as the fifth and immortality, he needed the special ceremony to assimilate all five.\nSee Also[]\nCasualty Puppet"}

{"jutsu_name":"Chidori","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Chidori is a high concentration of lightning chakra channelled around the user's hand.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Variants\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nThe Chidori was created by Kakashi Hatake after he failed to apply his lightning-nature to the Rasengan.[6] He intended for the Chidori to be a weapon used only to protect friends and loved ones.[7] To perform, the user first gathers lightning to their hand; the high concentration of electricity produces a sound reminiscent of many birds chirping, hence the name.[8] The lightning chakra has been shown on occasions to damage the user's hand, peeling the skin and causing it to smoulder slightly, but this does not appear to actually be debilitating.[9] Once the chakra is gathered, users charge at their target and thrust the Chidori into them, piercing them and typically causing fatal damage. Despite the sound it makes, the rapid speed at which it's used makes it useful for assassinations.[8]\nThe speed at which the Chidori is performed, despite being one of its greatest assets, also represents one of its biggest drawbacks: users move at their target so fast that its causes a tunnel vision-like effect for them. Because they charge in a straight line it is easy for opponents to attack them, and because of the tunnel vision it is difficult for the user to see these attacks, much less react to them. For this reason, most ninja cannot use the Chidori safely.[10] However, a user of the Sharingan can overcome these drawbacks due to its heightened visual perception preventing the tunnel vision from occurring and its predictive capabilities making it easier for the user to avoid counterattacks.[11] Hidari despite having a pair of Rinnegan finds using the jutsu hard to control, and believes the Sharingan is needed to master it.[12] Kakashi's skill with the Chidori eventually became so good that he was able to split a bolt of lightning with it, earning his Chidori the name \"Lightning Cutter\".[13]\nThe Chidori requires a large amount of chakra to be performed, placing a limit on how many times it can be used per day. In Part I, Kakashi can use it four times per day[14] and Sasuke Uchiha can use it twice per day under his own power.[15] Both increase their limits to an unspecified number in Part II. During Part II, Sasuke demonstrates several variations of the Chidori that have been given shape transformation, such as Chidori Senbon and Chidori Sharp Spear, both of which allow him to attack at a longer range than the Chidori is capable of.\n\nVariants[]\nSasuke has been shown using the Chidori with different chakra sources to grant his Chidori additional properties:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen drawing on the chakra of his Cursed Seal of Heaven, Sasuke uses a \"Flapping Chidori\" (羽撃く千鳥, Habataku Chidori, English TV: Black Chidori, literally meaning: Flapping One Thousand Birds),[16] which is stronger, darker in colour, and sounds like flapping wings rather than chirping birds.[17] Different video games have called it \"Wailing Chidori\" (慟哭の千鳥, Dōkoku no Chidori, literally meaning: Wailing One Thousand Birds, Game translation: Chidori Lament) and \"Black Chidori\" (黒い千鳥, Kuroi Chidori, literally meaning: Black One Thousand Birds). If accessed in his first state of the Cursed Seal, the Chidori is normally coloured purple instead in most forms of media.\n\n\n\n\nWhen imbued with the Six Paths Power, Sasuke's Chidori can be used to damage the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, whose body is otherwise impervious to standard ninjutsu.[18] In Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, this is called \"Dark Chidori\" (黒き千鳥, Kuroki Chidori, literally meaning: Dark One Thousand Birds, Game translation: Onyx Chidori).\n\n\n\n\nSasuke is briefly shown combining Chidori with Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi.[19] When it is clashed with Naruto Uzumaki's Rasengan, the resulting explosion destroys the statues at the Valley of the End and as well as both of their dominant arms.[20]\n\n\nTrivia[]\n\"Chidori\" (千鳥) can also be translated to \"plover\".\nThe name Chidori comes from a story about famous samurai Tachibana Dōsetsu: Tachibana was in possession of a famous sword called Chidori (千鳥, literally meaning: A Thousand Birds). One day, while he was still a young man, he was taking shelter under a tree, as it was raining. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck him. However, Tachibana used his Chidori to cut the Thunder God inside the lightning bolt, allowing him to survive. After this incident, he renamed his Chidori to Raikiri (雷切, literally meaning: Lightning Cutter).\nIn the original Naruto anime, Chidori looks like a white, sphere-shaped amount of electricity that surrounds the palm. This is corrected in the Naruto: Shippūden anime, where the Chidori is depicted as it is in the manga: a formless coverage of electricity all over the hand.\nHowever, in the video game J-Stars Victory Vs. and its + version, Sasuke's Chidori takes its incorrectly rendered sphere shape as aforementioned, but with the sphere contained within his hand (only during its startup animation and when Sasuke is running with the Chidori active).\nIn both Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 and 3, players can customise some characters to be able to use Chidori. In the former case, it is called \"Young Lightning\" in the English script when used by Anbu Kakashi.\nAlso, in some forms of media like the aforementioned games (along with Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 4 and Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2), Sasuke in his Cursed Seal of Heaven state (both level 1 and 2) often has the ability to perform both the normal version of his Chidori and its Cursed Seal version as separate techniques.\nHowever, in Jump Super Stars, despite using the Cursed Seal Chidori in his State 2 form for his Battle 7 Koma, Sasuke's Chidori is coloured purple akin to the State 1 version instead of dark-white.\nIn the trailers for Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Lightning Release Bullet: Powerful Breath makes the unique sound that Chidori makes.\nSee Also[]\nDrilling Hand of Sage Lightning\nHell Stab\nLightning Flash Palm\nLightning Release: Purple Electricity\nNadeshiko-Style Hardliner Gale Fist\nReferences[]\n\n↑ First Databook, page 209\n\n↑  Naruto: Shippūden episode 417\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Volume 3's Sasuke's Profile\n\n↑ Naruto episode 134\n\n↑ Naruto episode 67\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 321\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 177, page 8\n\n↑ 8.0 8.1 Naruto chapter 113, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 146, pages 13, 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 240, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 244, pages 4-6\n\n↑ Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 11, page 25\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 114, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 128, page 11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 128, page 9\n\n↑ Second Databook, page 51\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 232, pages 11-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 674\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 698, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 698, page 6"}

{"jutsu_name":"Chibaku Tensei","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Dōjutsu, Ninjutsu, Fūinjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the jutsu.

When the sphere is activated, it generates powerful attractive force, pulling everything in the vicinity to it until a large satellite is created;[2] users control how large the satellite becomes.[3] Creating a satellite apparently requires a great deal of chakra, such that Nagato, when attempting to use it through his Six Paths of Pain, must first bring the Deva Path close to his location so that he can channel his chakra to it more effectively, although it was done in his heavily exhausted state.[4]\nChibaku Tensei is most often used to restrain targets, drawing them in during the satellite's creation and trapping them beneath the mounds of rubble.[2] When used to capture tailed beasts, the resulting satellites are known as \"Tailed Beast Sealing Stones\" (尾獣封印の岩, Bijū Fūin no Iwa).[5] Only Naruto Uzumaki, by entering a near-Tailed Beast Mode, has been known to break free from one.[3] Because of how difficult it is to escape from Chibaku Tensei, the best way to counter it is to destroy the black sphere early on in the formation process. In order to penetrate the initial layers of rubble, users should use their most powerful attacks, such as the Tailed Beast Ball or Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. Actually aiming at the black sphere is not really necessary, as all attacks will be pulled towards it.[6]\n\n     Sasuke's multiple Chibaku Tensei.  \nWhen performed by Sasuke Uchiha, he does not use the typical black sphere, instead gathering rubble around each of his immobilised targets;[7] this is similar to the Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei. Once the satellites are formed, Sasuke is able to move them remotely.[8] Madara Uchiha is also shown creating multiple satellites at a time, each with its own black sphere. Rather than use the satellites to restrain targets, Madara uses them as large projectiles that he drops on his opponents.[9]\n\nVideo Games[]\nChibaku Tensei is a common move in Naruto video games:\n\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble, Pain generates a moderately sized sphere of debris overhead, then thrusts his arms downward, sending it crashing into the ground like a meteor. In the game it is called \"Six Paths Technique\" rather than Chibaku Tensei. An enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called \"Six Paths Technique: Collapse\" (六道の術・崩壊, Rikudō no Jutsu: Hōkai) can also be performed.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Pain uses Chibaku Tensei to summon a whirlwind of boulders to protect himself against attacks. He can also launch the boulders individually as a form of attack.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Impact, Pain creates the planetary body and brings it down on his opponents. He also uses this as his Awakening, where he summons a whirlwind of boulders as a defensive system and an offensive system at the same time.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, Nagato uses this technique to imprison his opponent, and then fires a chakra blast which goes through its core, causing a massive explosion.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution, as part of Pain and Konan's collaboration, Pain uses this technique to trap his opponent and then Konan lines the debris with explosive tags. Konan then sends a single origami bird which causes a massive explosion.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Rinnegan Sasuke pierces the opponent with the black flames, traps him within Chibaku Tensei, and then destroys it with Chidori Kagutsuchi via his Complete Body — Susanoo. His The Last version also uses the technique as part of his Chidori: Star Crusher. And during the boss battle against Naruto and Sasuke, Madara is able to create a gargantuan version of Chibaku Tensei by merging multiple planetoids into one with the Wood Release.\nTrivia[]\nDespite Madara using this technique in the manga, he is not listed as a user in Jin no Sho.[1]\nSee Also[]\nBanshō Ten'in\nShinra Tensei\nTengai Shinsei\nTrue: Chibaku Tensei\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Jin no Sho, pages 268-269\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 439, pages 1-7\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 440, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 438, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 551, pages 12-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 692, pages 14-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 696, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 676, pages 9-11"}

The amount of chakra transferred depends solely on the user.\n\nOverview[]\nThis technique was originally created by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki in order to \"connect\" the spiritual energies of every living person. His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of ninshū, but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. \n\nVariations[]\nCertain people, such as Minato Namikaze and Naruto Uzumaki could also mould the transferred chakra in order to adapt it to another person's specific chakra type.[1] In the latter's case, due to Kurama's chakra, it also enveloped the recipients in a chakra cloak similar to his \"Version 1\" form, albeit with no tails.[2] Once the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.\nKatsuyu and its summoners have a unique bond between them through Strength of a Hundred Seal and they can use Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing. Tsunade used this technique during Pain's invasion of Konoha, with Tsunade first transferring her healing chakra to Katsuyu, and then Katsuyu itself transferring it to the wounded villagers. Sakura used the same method of Tsunade with Katsuyu to heal wounded shinobi in Shinobi Alliance against Ten-Tails.[3]\nTsunade used again this technique during the five Kage's fight against Madara Uchiha to give Ōnoki some of her chakra so that he could use a massive Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique to defeat Madara's wood clones.[4] Sakura later used this technique to improve Obito's Kamui.\nZetsu's Spore Technique creates clones, which feed on chakra to grow are also able to transfer chakra to people they come in contact with.[5]\nDan Katō was able to use this technique as a spirit in Tsunade's consciousness to restore her chakra and Strength of a Hundred Seal.[6] Obito did something similar to give his chakra and dōjutsu powers to Kakashi after his body had been turned to ashes.[7]\nJūgo was able to transfer natural energy to someone thanks to his clan's unique ability.[8][9]\nTailed beasts are also able to freely share their chakra with whoever they choose, and as Kurama has noted, it is a less complicated process for them than it is for humans.[10][11]\nSamehada was able to absorb and transfer chakra to its wielder. It was also able to transfer chakra from Kisame back to Killer B.[12][13]\nHagoromo Ōtsutsuki was the first user of this technique to connect all humans living in the earth and gave the chakra to humanity besides his immediate family.[14] Hagoromo also used this technique inside of Naruto and Sasuke who are the reincarnations of Asura and Indra. He gave the power to them to defeat Madara. While using this technique, a unique entity appears behind Hagoromo with a marking reminiscent of a third eye in its forehead.[15]\nIn the anime, if the Aburame member has proper control, the kikaichū are also shown able to transfer their accumulated chakra to others targets, replenishing them.[16]\nIn the anime, the Magaki Group uses this technique in a different way. First Nangō sends his chakra to Benten and Chūshin, and then both of them send it along with its own to Akaboshi, greatly enhancing the power of his techniques.[17] He is able to shatter a barrier easily with his increased chakra.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 617, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 616\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 634, pages 7-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 588, pages 13-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 466, pages 9-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 591, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 688, page 2\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 413, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 618, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 572, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 609, pages 13-14\n\n↑ \"Naruto\" chapter 471, page 14\n\n↑ \"Naruto\" chapter 472, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 665, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 671, pages 14-16\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 304\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 144"}

{"jutsu_name":"Chakra Suppression Technique","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"This technique allows the user to suppress their or their allies' chakra to the point that it becomes completely undetectable. This makes it impossible for sensor type shinobi to track them via chakra. As noted by Shikamaru Nara, this technique is very useful in allowing one to infiltrate an enemy's ranks. However, due to having one's chakra suppressed, they will be unable to use jutsu.\nThe Ōtsutsuki Clan can naturally suppress their chakra signature. A vessel which been has sufficiently changed into an Ōtsutsuki can access this ability on instinct, without being consciously aware of its existence. Unlike regular shinobi, they're still able to use ninjutsu, as Kawaki created and maintained a shadow clone while suppressing his true body's chakra. However, fellow Ōtsutsuki and vessels can detect the user regardless."}

With them momentarily disorientated by this, Kabuto quickly gets behind his opponent and delivers a series of diagonal strikes. He moves away, and a moment later, the effects of his hits take hold; his opponent falls foward. As the opponent falls, he casually kicks the opponent in the face, knocking them on their back. \n\nTrivia[]\nIn his \"Awakened Mode\", it drains Kabuto's chakra to heal him while trying to perform this technique."}

They can, however, seal the chakra of anyone they hit for a time.\n\nMask Variation[]\nAt times, Yomito would remove his mask on his right arm and use it as a slicer for greater damage. Unlike the normal slicers, which seal opponent's chakra, this mask slicer would confuse the opponent, often leading them to attack their own friends. After attacking, the mask would mysteriously reappear on Yomito's arm."}
{"jutsu_name":"Chakra Scalpel","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Medical Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"This medical technique forms one's chakra into a small, sharp blade. This can then be used for highly accurate incisions necessary for surgeries and anatomical dissections.[1] Unlike regular scalpels, the chakra scalpel can make cuts inside the body without actually creating an open wound, limiting the risks of an infection.\nThe chakra scalpel can also be used offensively to inflict internal damage, although it requires great precision to be effective. Because of this requirement, using the chakra scalpel offensively is highly unusual. In heated combat, even the greatest medical-nin won't be able to exert the precision needed to target the vital spots, but it can still effectively cut muscle tissues and tendons, rendering the target immobile.\nKabuto has displayed enough skill with the technique to be able to deliver fatal cuts that can target vital spots, even cutting through wood and flesh with ease. He could also sever the chakra pathway system, which prevented a jinchūriki from receiving chakra from their tailed-beast. When enhanced with natural energy, he can even use it to sever a person’s body in half.[2][3][4][5][6]\n\nTrivia[]\nAlthough it is usually written in katakana, the \"mesu\" (メス, scalpel) part of the name was given kanji when it was first introduced. It was written as チャクラ解剖刀 (literally meaning: Chakra Dissection Blade), which would usually be pronounced as \"Chakura Kaibōtō\". \"Mesu\" is derived from the word \"Mes\", which is scalpel in Dutch.\nShizune uses this technique as a major portion of her fighting style in the Ultimate Ninja game series.\nSee Also[]\nGentle Fist\nMystical Palm Technique\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 663, pages 4-5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 168, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 290, pages 9-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 583, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 584, pages 7-10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 585, pages 16-17"}

He can shoot it at such high pressure that it can even shatter rocks. The substance is so durable that even when consecutively struck with a solid gold statue, it didn't break. It lasts two to three days before it crumbles. Jako claims that it was because he was such a foul person that his chakra had turned into what it was.\n\nTrivia[]\nJako's chakra liquid appears to be derived from Spider-Man's spider webbing, even mimicking the hand gesture Spider-Man uses when Jako activates the technique.\nIn Naruto Retsuden: Naruto Uzumaki and the Spiral Destiny, Chihare Amano experiments with liquid chakra to create a device that allows the use of multipotent chakra.

{"jutsu_name":"C2","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Hiden, Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"One of Deidara's specialities that requires the use of both of his palm mouths, creating a large dragon. The dragon itself is capable of flight, and, while Deidara is safely on its back, the dragon can spit out smaller clay figures that attack the opponent like guided missiles.\nThese independent missile-like creatures take the form of a greatly reduced version of the larger dragon that created them, however, despite this decrease in size they are still relatively larger than a normal person. Each is capable of tracking their intended target and producing a significant explosion proportional to size upon contact but as they emerge, they consume a substantial amount of clay from the original dragon, initially extracting it from the creature's tail. This ultimately limits the number that each C2 \"Dragon\" is capable of creating, before clay must be sacrificed from more vital areas, such as the body or wings. By using more clay, the missile's size and explosive power can be substantially increased.\nThe dragon can also produce clay mines at the expense of clay, that take the form of small spherical creatures, which can be subsequently manipulated to force opponents to fight in a limited space. This is achieved through the use of Tobi's Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique, to hide a large amount of these mines underground, without the opponents' knowledge to their exact location. When this tactic is combined with the previously mentioned missiles, it can confine the enemies' movements to such an extent, that they are forced to suffer an explosion.\n\nTrivia[]\n\"C-2\", also known as Composition C-2, is Composition C plastic explosive developed during the Second World War.\nAccording to Tobi, this is Deidara's favourite technique involving explosive clay.[1]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 357, page 16"}

In this form, the user's combat ability is greatly enhanced; allowing the use of the clan's high-level techniques such as Butterfly Bullet Bombing, and the ability to use the chakra wings to create gusts of chakra.\nThere are two methods of entering this mode. The first is through use of the Akimichi's Three Coloured Pills, which aggressively convert all of the user's calories into chakra; if the pills are not regulated properly, the user may die from the rapid weight loss. Practised users are able to convert their calories into chakra on their own through a process known as Calorie Control (カロリーコントロール , Karorī Kontorōru); because they are in complete control of how much of their body weight is turned into chakra, it poses less of a risk to the user.\nIn the anime, it is shown that using this form without proper control will in fact greatly diminish one's performance.[2] It is also shown that even while in this slim state, the user can still perform various expansion techniques.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 271\n\n↑ Boruto episode 67\n\n↑ Boruto episode 156"}

The spring water produced by The Hole appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.[1] The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.[2]\nOnce the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head. Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides. Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.[3] While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large snakes, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\nKabuto first used this technique to create a clone of Akatsuki member Hidan by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman. Later, snakes which had been ingested by Naruto Uzumaki created a clone of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him. Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of Kurama's chakra, was formed in Naruto's four-tailed Version 2 state and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail. The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nWhile in The Hole, Kabuto compared this process to a viral infection, presumably due to how rapidly it occurs.\nThe clones created through this method lack clothing, unlike individuals revived with Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation.\nSee Also[]\nSummoning: Impure World Reincarnation\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 290\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 294\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 Naruto: Shippūden episode 292"}

Villages can even have their own variants, as in the Mist Body Flicker (霧瞬身, Kiri-Shunshin), Water Body Flicker (水瞬身, Mizu-Shunshin), and Leaf Body Flicker (木ノ葉瞬身, Konoha-Shunshin, literally meaning: Tree Leaf Body Flicker).[1]\nAlthough the Body Flicker Technique is common to almost all shinobi, some are particularly renowned for their usage of it. Shisui Uchiha was feared as \"Shisui of the Body Flicker\" (瞬身のシスイ, Shunshin no Shisui); whenever he employed this technique, Shisui would fade away from sight, leaving no trace of his presence. In the anime, Shisui was also able to generate clones through the technique. When the Third Raikage utilised the technique, it looked like a bolt of lightning appeared and disappeared from the area. The Fourth Raikage often combined the Body Flicker Technique with the Lightning Release Chakra Mode which allowed him to dodge Amaterasu.\n\nTrivia[]\nCertain space–time ninjutsu are sometimes confused with the Body Flicker Technique, as it creates the illusion of the user instantly moving from one place to another. However, whereas space–time ninjutsu actually transport the user through space, this technique is merely high-speed movement.[2] Despite this, the Flying Thunder God Technique is regularly called the \"Body Flicker Technique\" by various individuals, including the technique's creator.[3][4]\nFurther confusion exists in some translations of the series. In Viz's English translations, the Body Flicker Technique is called \"Teleportation\", whereas space–time ninjutsu are generally referred to as \"Transportation Techniques\".\nThe Body Flicker Technique is similar to Swift Release, a kekkei genkai that allows the user to move at high speeds.\nSee Also[]\nSwift Release: Shadowless Flight\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Rin no Sho, page 197\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 395, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 240, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 637, page 14"}

{"jutsu_name":"Black Receiver","jutsu_type":"Kekkei Genkai, Ninjutsu, Dōjutsu","jutsu_description":"Black Receivers are black rods that function as demodulators for high-frequency chakra signals.[11] Users are able to create and transmit their chakra into these receivers for a variety of purposes.\n\nContents\n\n1 Origin\n2 Usage\n3 Trivia\n4 References\n\n\nOrigin[]\nBlack receivers are said to be a trademark of the Rinnegan.[1] Wielders of the dōjutsu are able to generate the rods from their own bodies, usually from the palms of their hands.[12] However, there have been several instances in which black rods were produced through other means:\n\nWhile connected to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Madara Uchiha produced a black rod from Hashirama's artificial body and identified it as a physical manifestation of his will. He then told Obito Uchiha to use it when performing the Six Paths Technique.[9]\nBlack rods have been seen protruding from the Demonic Statue's midsection at times.[13] On one occasion, these rods pierced Nagato's back and drained him of his life force,[14] which allowed him to control the statue.[15]\nBlack rods have sprouted from Obito's artificial right half on several occasions: upon first awakening his Mangekyō Sharingan and using Wood Release,[16] when Madara used the rods to control his actions,[17] and when Black Zetsu first coated his body and forced him to revive Madara.[18]\nWhen Obito was the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, he converted one of his Truth-Seeking Balls into six black receivers, which he used to activate the Six Red Yang Formation.[19]\nUsage[]\n     Rods transmitting chakra.  \nBlack receivers are formed out of chakra,[20] which takes on a consistency similar to metal. They are durable enough to break steel scalpels,[21] as well as sharp enough to pierce through human bodies with ease.[22] Though durable, the rods can still be destroyed when struck with sufficient force,[23] and their creator is able to break them apart without any apparent difficulty.[24] Once formed, the user can transmit chakra to these receivers from across vast distances, though for best results, they must be nearby and at a high elevation.[25] Though chakra being sent to these receivers can be sensed, a skilled user can prevent their location from being discovered by constantly changing the frequency of their chakra.[26] Offensively employing receivers from afar carries a risk, as those with sensing capabilities can trace the transmitted chakra back to the user when pierced with one.[27] When receiving chakra, the black rods noticeably heat up.[11]\n\n     The user transmits chakra into the victim's body.  \nBy stabbing an opponent with the rods, the user can transmit their chakra into the target's body, disrupting their own chakra and throwing off their movements.[28][29] The user can fully immobilise the target by stabbing them with multiple rods,[24] as well as prevent them from moulding additional chakra by piercing their tenketsu.[8] Provided the user is close enough, they can potentially control the target's movements, though this can be resisted if the target's own chakra is powerful enough.[30] Aside from being stabbed, simply touching the receivers can apparently also incur negative effects,[8] though Rinnegan wielders are seemingly immune.[31]\nChakra receivers are also used to control the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that possess copies of the Rinnegan, granting them a shared field of vision with their creator. Nagato controlled his Six Paths of Pain using numerous receivers fashioned into piercings, which were implanted all about their bodies,[32] whereas Obito had a single rod implanted in each body's chest.[33] Among other Rinnegan abilities, the bodies are capable of producing additional rods to serve as weapons.[34] As they are controlled by the user's chakra, opponents can prevent these bodies from moving by removing all of their receivers.[35] The receivers implanted in Obito's Six Paths of Pain doubled as a means of temporarily binding the chakra of the tailed beasts sealed inside the Demonic Statue to their bodies, making them into jinchūriki.[36] When they entered Tailed Beast Mode, the receivers would relocate from the jinchūriki's chests up to the tailed beasts' necks.[37] The creatures Nagato summoned through the Animal Path were also embedded with numerous receivers, suggesting he controlled them in a similar manner.\n\n     Chakra chains manifested through giant stakes.  \nWhen employed offensively, the black rods make for effective weapons. They can emerge from the user's hand to stab opponents,[38] be broken off and wielded like swords,[39] or be launched as high-speed projectiles,[40] and the size and shape of the generated receivers can be adjusted to fit the situation.[22] Obito is shown employing black receivers fashioned into giant stakes as projectiles, ejecting them from Kamui's dimension to pierce and pin targets.[41] He can also manifest chakra chains to bind those touching the receivers with an even greater binding power.[42] In the anime, the user can also apply shape transformation to the rods after launching them, altering them into more elaborate forms.[43]\nBlack receivers disintegrate when their creator is killed or similarly incapacitated, alongside any Truth-Seeking Balls they may possess.[44][40]\n\nTrivia[]\nObito implied the binding power of the black rods is related to the Outer Path.[42] However, Madara was able to use their binding power even after losing his Rinnegan.[10]\nSimilar to Truth-Seeking Balls, black receivers appear to hinder the regenerative qualities of Impure World Reincarnation to some extent, as the wounds of reincarnated individuals do not immediately heal while the rods are pierced through their bodies,[45] though they do eventually heal.[31]\nNaruto Uzumaki used something similar to black receivers when he shaped his Truth-Seeking Balls into rods and used them to immobilise Madara and Black Zetsu.[46][47]\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble, Pain's Black Needle Stab temporarily reverses the controls of those stabbed by his black rods.\nIsshiki Ōtsutsuki has employed similar tools; however, they're different in that Isshiki has no Rinnegan, and they function differently. His absorb chakra instead of transmitting his own to disrupt the chakra of those it pierces.[48]\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Jin no Sho, page 255\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 420, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 420, page 16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 428, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 436, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 565, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 569, page 5\n\n↑ 8.0 8.1 8.2 Naruto chapter 661, page 11\n\n↑ 9.0 9.1 Naruto chapter 606, page 16\n\n↑ 10.0 10.1 Naruto chapter 657, page 5\n\n↑ 11.0 11.1 Naruto chapter 420, pages 15-16\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 647, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 512, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Jin no Sho, page 247\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 447, pages 8-13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 605, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 636, pages 15-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 656, pages 16-17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 643, pages 9-11\n\n↑ Boruto: Naruto the Movie novelisation, chapter 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 418, page 14\n\n↑ 22.0 22.1 Naruto chapter 381, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 433, page 7\n\n↑ 24.0 24.1 Naruto chapter 437, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 436, pages 3-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 435, pages 11-12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 441, pages 12-15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 381, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 420, pages 8-9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 444, pages 3-4\n\n↑ 31.0 31.1 Naruto chapter 673, page 9\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 421, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 565, pages 9-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 378, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 443, pages 3-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 570, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 569, pages 5-6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 636, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 442, pages 7-9\n\n↑ 40.0 40.1 Boruto: Naruto the Movie\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 598, pages 9-10\n\n↑ 42.0 42.1 Naruto chapter 569, page 10\n\n↑ Boruto episode 135\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 680, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 661, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 675, pages 10-11\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 688, page 6\n\n↑ Boruto chapter 36, page 34"}

Because there is even more chakra being compressed to a higher density, the ball releases its energy immediately on contact, thus increasing its destructive power beyond the Rasengan's.[1] In the anime, it is noted that one requires immense amounts of chakra to create a Big Ball Rasengan at all.[3]\nWhen Naruto first starts using the Big Ball Rasengan, he needs a shadow clone to help him form and wield it.[4] He is able to wield it with one hand when his skill with it improves, though he still needs a clone's help in its formation.[5]\n\nUsage and Improvement[]\nLike the original Rasengan, Naruto improved the Big Ball Rasengan and created a variant with his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. The size and power of his Big Ball Rasengan also improved, with it growing to nearly half the size of the Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan.[5] He can also add Wind Release to it, to create the Big Ball Rasenshuriken.[6]\n\nSenjutsu Influence[]\n    Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan.  \nWhen in Sage Mode, Naruto can use a senjutsu-enhanced version known as Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan (仙法・大玉螺旋丸, Senpō: Ōdama Rasengan, English TV: Sage Art: Giant Rasengan). As with the original, Naruto uses a shadow clone to help him form the ball. With this senjutsu version, however, he can have a shadow clone form a Big Ball Rasengan in each of his hands, which he can then pass to the clones for them to wield. The Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan is much larger than the original, almost being as big as Pain's summons.[7]\n\n\nTrivia[]\nMinato Namikaze could use this technique in Jiraiya's novel within Tsunade's Infinite Tsukuyomi dream.[8]\nBy the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto's regular Rasengan had increased to near Big Ball Rasengan size.\nWhen Konohamaru used this technique in an OVA, he was able to use it with one hand.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Third Databook, page 228\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 188\n\n↑ Boruto episode 168\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 260, page 10\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 561, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 655, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 431, page 10\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 441"}

Even though they look identical, the ninken - because it's an animal - is likely to give away which of the two is which from how it moves and acts.

{"jutsu_name":"Baryon Mode","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"This article is about the jutsu. For Boruto chapter 52, see Baryon Mode.\n\n\n\nBaryon Mode (重粒子モード, Barion Mōdo) is a unique transformation accessible to Kurama with its jinchūriki. It uses all of Kurama's chakra present in its jinchūriki, resulting in the permanent exhaustion of the Tailed Beast's chakra in the user.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Drawbacks\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nIn this state, Naruto's hair becomes spikier, standing up on its ends with tufts on each side of his head appearing as fox ears. His whisker markings become thicker, with the upper ones on each side curving up below his eyes. The pigments around his eyes become black and stretch up towards his makeshift fox ears, and he takes on Kurama's red-slit eyes. The colouring of his clothes turns slightly darker orange, and he gains a chakra cape with a black swirl in the middle of his chest. Flowing from the back of his cape are four orange (red in the anime) chakra tails, with five more at the end of the cape; each tail has a black line down the centre that connects in the middle of the cape as a swirl.\nIn a process similar to nuclear fusion, Naruto's and Kurama's chakra are consumed as raw materials to produce a new type of energy. The increase in chakra was enough to shock both Isshiki and Sasuke, with the latter noting it being tremendous. When in use, it dramatically boosts Naruto's reflexes, speed, and power to such extremes that he even surpasses Isshiki's capabilities, allowing him to snatch the Ōtsutsuki's black rods out of the air before they are visibly enlarged, as well as dodge and effortlessly parry attacks.[2] Kurama notes that because all chakra is connected, contact with an opponent will drain their lifespan as well.[2]\n\nDrawbacks[]\nAs powerful as Baryon Mode is, it is extremely dangerous if used for too long or recklessly, making this form a \"double-edged sword\". Doing so will gradually drain at the user's strength and very lifespan. Because of the extreme risk, the user must not make any unnecessary movements, nor act on any stray thoughts, focusing on only the most calculated of moves to keep Baryon Mode stable. Even more, over-usage of this form comes at an even greater risk at Kurama's life altogether, effectively killing it. Upon reaching the breaking point, Kurama's entire being will be destroyed, depriving Naruto of all the kitsune's chakra and capacities. However, the removal of Kurama from its jinchūriki will not endanger the latter's life. Despite his death, Kurama was eventually revived as with any Tailed Beasts who would die, albeit not within Naruto.\n\nTrivia[]\nBaryons are heavy subatomic particles that are composed of three quarks. The most common examples are protons and neutrons, which are the particles that undergo fusion in the Sun.\nBaryon Mode seems to embody the Will of Fire, with Naruto's chakra cloak incorporating the symbol and strongly resembling the monument in the Konoha Cemetery. It also resembles Kushina's hair when she's angry, getting into her \"Red Hot-Blooded Habanero\" moniker.\nSee Also[]\nEight Gates Released Formation\nNine-Tails Chakra Mode\nNinja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique\nSix Paths Sage Mode\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Boruto Database: Baryon Mode\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Boruto chapter 52"}

Should the need arise, the toad can be used to transport whatever it has captured, releasing its contents when given the command.\nThe environment inside the toad's stomach is a cavernous chamber, which includes a lake of strong corrosive gastric acid that can dissolve anything that should happen to fall into it, along with shores around the acid lake, and rock formations sticking out of the lake; the already-existing structures within the Toad's stomach are seemingly unaffected by the acid lake. Once trapped inside, an opponent is cut off from any allies and susceptible to attack, and can then be easily defeated.\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Sha no Sho, page 253"}

Even if the tags are discovered, actually disarming them is very difficult, for which reason it's generally safer to simply avoid the area.[1] Shikaku Nara once forced his son, Shikamaru, to read a book that discussed this technique, which described it as \"a high-class ninjutsu\".[2]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution, String Light Formation is incorrectly named as this technique.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Tō no Sho, page 220\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 185"}

For other uses, see Asura (disambiguation).\n\n\n\nThe Asura Path (修羅道, Shuradō) grants the user the ability to augment their own body to summon mechanised armour and various ballistic and mechanical weaponry.[2]  During his lifetime, Nagato channelled the Asura Path through the body of a ninja puppeteer.\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Mechanisms\n3 Influences\n4 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nThrough the Asura Path, the user is able to form up to four additional arms and two additional faces, as well as a folded, serrated blade-like sash around their waist. These additional appendages, as well as the user's body as a whole, are augmented with a variety of mechanical weaponry, which they can access at will. The user can fire their forearms as long-range projectiles or pull them off to reveal and fire a cluster of segmented missiles at targets. They are also able to protrude a set of flexible blades and drills or a series of mechanical tendrils from their arms, as well as quickly propel themselves forward by emitting a burst of chakra from holes in their feet. The user can also release a powerful chakra blast, which is capable of destroying numerous buildings at once, either by transforming one of their hands into a cannon or by opening the crown of their head.\nThe body through which Nagato channelled the Asura Path displayed enough raw physical power to rip Jiraiya's arm off and crush his throat with basic taijutsu, as well as to throw the Animal Path all the way into Konohagakure from the outskirts of the village. Additionally, the Asura Path was able to survive otherwise fatal damage due to its mechanised insides. All of these abilities befitted the \"warring demon\" name that the Asura Path held, whilst giving it a considerable degree of versatility.\n\n\nMechanisms[]\nThe detached hand being launched.As displayed through Nagato's Path, not only was the arm detachable, but a cluster of segmented missiles produced from within it.The arm itself could be used as a launching pad to launch the missiles.The Path's head opening up to reveal a cannon.The Path being propelled with mechanisms from the feet. The right hand also shows additional weapons being produced.Additional arms being equipped in battle.\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Asura realm is the plane of semi-divine warring demons which people are reincarnated in due to actions based on jealousy, struggle, combat or rationalisation in a previous life, and though powerful, live in constant violence and conflict to which there is no resolution nor peace. Following a common depiction of Asura, this ability allows the user to possess six arms and three faces, each of which display a different emotion. Like Deva, Asura are also a race of supernatural beings. They are also featured in Hinduism as divine beings, and are known to live a life pursuing power, while indulgent and representative of materialistic and carnal pleasures. Both depictions play in the abilities of the Asura Path.\nIt also draws inspiration from Hinduism, where Asuras in mythology purportedly had the ability (called Astra) to use magical equivalents to modern day biological missiles.\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 257\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 551, page 6"}

Sasuke can also use this technique to escape from restraints and bind an opponent in his place,[5] or to discard any foreign weapons embedded in his body.[6] Despite this technique stemming from his Rinnegan, Sasuke does not actually need to be looking at an object in order to swap places with it.[7]\nSasuke can also target other objects and individuals with this technique in order to shift them to another space in his surroundings.[8] This allows him to transport a weapon into his hand, or to project one of his techniques, such as the Chidori, to a remote location.[5] By launching an attack and then bringing his opponent to him at the last possible moment, Sasuke can ensure that his techniques hit their mark.[9] However, the opponent must be within a certain range of him for this to take effect, and with sufficient speed, it is possible to escape this technique's range before it can be activated.[10] While storing the chakra of the nine tailed beasts within his Susanoo, Sasuke demonstrated the ability to shift both himself and his Susanoo behind Naruto Uzumaki, who was a considerable distance away.[11]\nUpon first obtaining his Rinnegan, Sasuke had to wait for his eye to recharge after using this technique several times in quick succession,[12] and further overuse would cause his eye to bleed.[13] In adulthood, Sasuke is able to use this technique even while his Rinnegan's ocular power is diminished due to using its other abilities.[14][15]\n\nInfluence[]\nThis technique's name comes from Ame-no-tajikarao, the Japanese deity who used his brute strength to pull Amaterasu out of the cave where she was hiding from her brother, thus returning sunlight to the world.

Because Amenominaka works on everybody in the vicinity of Kaguya, she cannot use it to escape from attackers or to transport only certain individuals to other dimensions; for both purposes, she instead relies on Yomotsu Hirasaka.[5] Kaguya does seem to have some control over where she and the others will appear within a dimension, giving her a strategic option: when first depicted, she shifts high into the air of her lava dimension, leaving her opponents to fall into the molten sea below;[2] when she is being attacked by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, she shifts to a part of her ice dimension that places Naruto and Sasuke within a glacier, trapping them and thus stopping their attack.[5]\nWhen Kakashi Hatake first experiences Amenominaka, he believes it is the result of a genjutsu because of how suddenly it happens and how stark the change is from where he was (Earth). It is only from noticing that the new world is too vast in size and intricate in detail that he realises it cannot be a mere illusion.[2] He nevertheless revisits the genjutsu comparison later, noting that - from his perspective - Kaguya seems to be instantly rewriting reality with each use of Amenominaka.[5]\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique's name comes from Amenominakanushi (天之御中主神, Heavenly Ancestral God of the Originating Heart of the Universe), a Japanese deity who is said to be the absolute centre of the universe, as well as the first Hitorigami that came in to existence, and one of the five Kotoamatsukami.\nUltimate Ninja Storm 4 gives each dimensional shift a unique name; Amenominaka: \"Lava\" (熔, Yō, literally meaning: Corrosion), \"Ice\" (氷, Hyō), \"Sand\" (砂, Masago), as well as one for returning from her dimensions, \"Return\" (戻, Modoshi).\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Jin no Sho, page 230\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 Naruto chapter 680, pages 1-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 684, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 680, page 10\n\n↑ 5.0 5.1 5.2 Naruto chapter 682"}

For the Naruto: Shippūden episode, see Amaterasu!.\n\n\n\nAmaterasu is a Mangekyō Sharingan dōjutsu, and the highest level of Fire Release.[2] Said to represent the \"Material World and Light\" (物質界と光, Busshitsukai to Hikari), Amaterasu is the antipode to Tsukuyomi.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Influence\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nOverview[]\n     Amaterasu overpowering regular flames.  \nAmaterasu produces black flames at the focal point of the user's vision.[3] In most situations, this makes Amaterasu impossible to avoid. However, with enough speed, it is possible to avoid, dodge,[4] or intercept the jutsu before it has been cast.[5][6] Said to be \"the fires from hell\" and to burn as hot as the sun itself,[1] Amaterasu burns any material — other flames included — until nothing but ash remains.[7] Throughout the series some objects have shown a degree of imperviousness to the flames, such as Gaara's chakra-infused sand[8] and Naruto's Version 1 chakra cloak.[9] Befitting their description as never disappearing and immortal,[10] Amaterasu's flames cannot be extinguished through most conventional means and will continue burning until their target is completely incinerated;[11] only the user can put out the flames.[12]\nAmaterasu does not ordinarily require hand seals to be performed, though Sasuke Uchiha once used the Tiger hand seal, which is common for fire techniques.[13] This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person.[14] Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks.[15]\nUse of this technique puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed. Though the user can make Amaterasu incinerate things near-instantly when focusing on it, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly normally, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body part(s) before it spreads.[16] Other defensive options are pushing the flames away,[17] absorbing them through the Rinnegan,[18] Kāma absorption,[19] certain space–time ninjutsu,[20] or being the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails.[21] While impractical as a defence, Amaterasu can also be sealed.\nBecause of the ability of his right Mangekyō Sharingan, Sasuke can control and shape the flames of Amaterasu using Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi.\n\nInfluence[]\nAmaterasu, like Tsukuyomi and Susanoo, is a god in ancient Japanese myth and the Shintō religion. Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, was born from the left eye of Izanagi when he performed the cleansing ritual after escaping the underworld.\n\nTrivia[]\nDespite being initially described as spawning at the user's point of focus, Amaterasu has at times been depicted as traveling through space towards its targets, making it possible for other high speed techniques to counter it.[22]\nSee Also[]\nHinokagutsuchi\nTrue Fire of Samadhi\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 Second Databook, page 200\n\n↑ Third Databook, page 289\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 390, page 3\n\n↑ Boruto episode 218\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 463, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 464, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 390, page 1\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 464, page 12\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 697, pages 6-7\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 236\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 391, page 5\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 415, pages 7-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 682, page 4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 397, pages 1-4\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 463, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 635, page 13\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 550, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 657, pages 2-3\n\n↑ Boruto episode 204\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 397, pages 2-8\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 642, page 1-3\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 390"}

Using Inoichi's telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\nThe first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust. Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills. \nThe second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water. Konoha's Sarutobi clan would then heat this mixture into concrete, trapping the Ten-Tails.\nWith the Ten-Tails restrained, the rest of the alliance would rush Madara and Obito using taijutsu, having coordinated with Naruto to exploit their weaknesses.\n\nTrivia[]\nDespite the name, the Allied Shinobi Forces Technique is not a specific technique used by the army, but rather a collaboration of different techniques being used to achieve a single goal.\nDespite successfully restraining the Ten-Tails momentarily, the beast's further evolution allowed it to overpower its restraints before the Alliance had a chance to combat Madara and Obito directly.\nIn Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, a shortened version of the formation is used instead, consisting only of the lowering of the Ten-Tails into the ground, and the concrete used to immobilise it."}

Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.[2] The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.[1] In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.[3] Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.[4]\n\nThe chains creating a barrier.The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.1/2\nA barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.[5] Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' jinchūriki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent. Orochimaru labels this the same ability as Kushina possessed,[7] but Jin no Sho describes it only as a \"glimpse\" of Kushina's Adamantine Sealing Chains.[1]\n\nSee Also[]\nBeast Sealing Technique\nDemonic Statue Chains\nReferences[]\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Jin no Sho, page 253\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 498\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 408\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 503\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 504\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 501\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 663"}

{"jutsu_name":"Adamantine Prison Wall","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu, Clone Techniques, Bukijutsu","jutsu_description":"After using Transformation: Adamantine Staff, Enma clones himself to create a lattice box around a target. Because of the toughness of Enma's adamantine form, opponents cannot break through the box once it's formed. When this box is formed around allies, this effectively protects them from harm. When it is formed around opponents, this effectively imprisons them until Enma chooses to release them.[1]\n\nTrivia[]\nVajra (金剛, Kongō) is a weapon used as a ritual object to symbolise both the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force).

{"jutsu_name":"Acrobat","jutsu_type":"Taijutsu, Kenjutsu","jutsu_description":"The Acrobat (荒繰鷺伐刀, Akurobatto) is a kenjutsu used by Killer B in tandem with his swords and the standard technique of his unique Disturbance Taijutsu fighting style.\n\nUsage[]\nWhen in battle, B holds his swords in a peculiar and unique manner. More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body. The first two are held in the hinge joint of his right and left arm, another between his shoulder blade and neck, one in his mouth, under his left armpit, another between the hip joint of his right, raised leg and the back leg of the same raised leg. As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.[3] The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha,[4] and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu Hōzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.[5] Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.[6]\nThe swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.[7] Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.[8] In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.[9]\n\nTrivia[]\nAs with many techniques of Kumogakure ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 229\n\n↑ Naruto Collectible Card Game\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 542, page 6\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 411, page 14\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 411, page 15\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 411, page 18\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 411, page 17\n\n↑ Naruto chapter 550, page 3\n\n↑ Naruto: Shippūden episode 298"}

{"jutsu_name":"Acid Permeation","jutsu_type":"Ninjutsu","jutsu_description":"Utakata blows acidic bubbles from his pipe that burn anything it comes into contact with. The sheer multitude and wide-range it can cover makes avoiding it very difficult.\n\nTrivia[]\nSantōka is the given name of Santōka Taneda (種田山頭火, Taneda Santōka). He was a haiku poet, well-known for his free style haiku lacking the traditional 5-7-5 syllabic rule and seasonal word. He is called a wandering poet for the many trips he took in his later life as a Buddhist monk, wandering through Japan without being part of a monastery.\nThe san in Santōka's name is actually written with the kanji for mountain (山), but for this technique, it is interpreted as acid (酸), also pronounced san. Tōka is interpreted as meaning permeation (透過) instead of head (頭) and fire (火), which it means in Santōka's name.\nAlthough he wasn't shown using this technique in the manga, it was stated he could mix acid in with his bubble ninjutsu.[1] This is also demonstrated in Naruto Mobile.\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Fourth Databook, page 37"}

For Zetsu's personal technique, see Substitute Technique.\n\n\n\n\nThe instant before they are to be struck by an attack, the user replaces themselves with a block of wood or something similar. Because the attack does hit something, opponents may briefly believe that they've successfully struck the user. But this is merely an optical illusion and opponents will quickly notice what's happened. If users are fast enough, they can use this brief lapse in the opponent's attentions to stage a counterattack;[1] in the anime, the replacement log itself has been shown used as an attack, being applied with explosive tags.[2] Alternatively, this is a good opportunity for users to escape.[1]\nThe Body Replacement Technique can evidently only be used in response to what would be harmful attacks: Pain only escapes from Jiraiya's Wild Lion's Mane Technique when Jiraiya tries to kill him with it; when Jiraiya uses the same technique to only keep Pain restrained, Pain remains captured.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique is based on a real-life ninja art, kawarimi, where ninja substitute themselves with anything that can be mistaken for them (such as a dummy or a mannequin).\nAs it means \"a quick shift in position, or adaptability to changing circumstances\", it is also utilised in Sumo.\nIn other series, abilities similar to the Body Replacement Technique are sometimes referred to as the \"Empty Cicada Technique\" (\u7a7a\u8749\u306e\u8853, Utsusemi no Jutsu) (not to be confused with the Empty Cicada Shell Technique, which uses the exact same kanji). This name refers to the empty shell a cicada leaves after moulting.\nIn Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 and subsequent games in the series, Killer B uses the Eight-Tails' severed tentacles to mask his escapes.\nIn Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2, Akamaru substitutes himself with a bone rather than a block of wood.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 Rin no Sho, page 177\n\n\u2191 Naruto episode 72\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 374, page 15"},

The spring water produced by The Hole appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.[1] The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.[2]\nOnce the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head. Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides. Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.[3] While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large snakes, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\nKabuto first used this technique to create a clone of Akatsuki member Hidan by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman. Later, snakes which had been ingested by Naruto Uzumaki created a clone of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him. Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of Kurama's chakra, was formed in Naruto's four-tailed Version 2 state and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail. The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.[3]\n\nTrivia[]\nWhile in The Hole, Kabuto compared this process to a viral infection, presumably due to how rapidly it occurs.\nThe clones created through this method lack clothing, unlike individuals revived with Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation.\nSee Also[]\nSummoning: Impure World Reincarnation\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 290\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 294\n\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 292"},

Ordinarily, the brain sends electric signals to the body to control how it moves.

The user then delivers a series of attacks to a target that is within the symbol's perimeter, striking sixty-four of their tenketsu.

Users perform each set of strikes within the same length of time, but because each set has more strikes than the one before it, the set's strikes become increasingly faster. The last set, during which thirty-two strikes are performed, is especially difficult, demanding great resolve and a strong step forward to pull off.[3] As targets are struck, they are increasingly knocked backwards, with the combined force of the final sets being great enough to push them through tree trunks.[4] The six sets of strikes are:\n\nTwo consecutive strikes.\nTwo more consecutive strikes, totalling four.\nFour consecutive strikes, totalling eight.\nEight consecutive strikes, totalling sixteen.\nSixteen consecutive strikes, totalling thirty-two.\nThirty-two consecutive strikes, totalling sixty four.\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, Shira was able to block all sixty-four strikes because of his speed and taijutsu skill.[5]\nSee Also[]\nProtecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Rin no Sho, page 217\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 195\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 633\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 194\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 400"},

It will also drain them of their chakra at a slow but steady rate. Mui uses this technique on the prisoners of the H\u014dzuki Castle. If the ones who have the seal on them leaves a certain radius from the applier, then it would cause the victims to burst into flames from the inside,[1] burning them to ashes. The user can also ignite the seal at their own free will.\nHowever, for people with high amounts of chakra, such as Naruto, they can still mould chakra and use techniques to a certain extent. The techniques used, however, will be severely hampered, and the seal will cause the user in question intense pain, as though their bodies were on fire; if too much chakra is forced out, the formula will set the victim ablaze.\nIt is possible for an individual to undo the Heavenly Prison placed by another, as Benga undid \"Tsukiyo's\" that was placed by Muj\u014d.[1]\n\nDrawbacks[]\nBeing a fire technique, it cannot work in water, and the victims simply has to submerge themselves in a body of water to use chakra with ease; anyone set aflame by this technique can be saved if water is poured over them. Also, this technique only suppresses normal chakra from within one's body; when enhanced with natural energy gathered externally, one is still able to use chakra. If anyone with the seal applied were able to create a shadow clone, the clone will not bear the seal. The seal will disappear if the user dies.\n\nTrivia[]\nDespite being seemingly bound by the Heavenly Prison, Maroi was able to use Lightning Release: Lightning Signal Fire and Water Release: Archerfish without adverse effects. This may due to Maroi gaining favour of Mui, thus negating the sealing.\nA caster of this technique can place a false seal on the victim, creating only the markings without the effects, as Muj\u014d did on Boruto Uzumaki and Mitsuki, to allow them to enter the prison undercover.[2] This may be what Mui did on Maroi.\nDespite Naruto being branded with this technique, when he transformed into Sage Mode, he was able to leave a great distance from Mui when Gamabunta escaped the castle to rethink their strategy without Naruto bursting into flames.\nThe Ice Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice has been considered to be on par with the Heavenly Prison in terms of restraining prisoners, hence the reason its user was named Mui's successor as H\u014dzuki Castle's master.\nSee Also[]\nCursed Tongue Eradication Seal\nIce Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice\nPrisoner Cursed Seal\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Boruto episode 146\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 141"},

In order to pursue this view, as well as to apply it towards combat,[2] he stole a kinjutsu passed down in Iwagakure that allows its user to knead chakra into materials.[4] Deidara feeds clay to one of his body's mouths \u2013 most commonly the mouth on his left palm \u2013 giving them shape and turning them into explosives. The power and type of explosion is determined by the chakra that he applies to the clay.[2] In Akatsuki Hiden, the quality of the clay is also an important consideration, as inferior clays won't take the exact form that Deidara intends nor will their detonation be as impressive. The white clay used in Ceramic Village for Hanasaki ceramics is the best clay Deidara has found.\nThe explosives are initially palm-sized, making them easy to prepare in advance and then carry into combat.[5] To make practical use of them, however, it is necessary that Deidara enlarge them. This in turn brings the clay creation to life, which Deidara can control remotely depending on how large it was made: an average-sized bird can be sent flying at an opponent as an attack;[6] a large bird can be used as a form of transportation, and once he reaches his destination he can send it flying at an opponent as an attack.[7] To detonate the clay, he makes the Seal of Confrontation and says \"katsu\" (\u559d).[2]\nBecause Deidara relies on his clay to make his explosives, running out of clay severely limits his options in battle.[8] Low chakra reserves also place Deidara at a disadvantage, as his mouths will struggle to shape the clay into usable forms.[9] Deidara's clay is all earth-based, meaning that opponents can defuse the explosives with Lightning Release.[10]\n\nClay Ranking[]\nDeidara ranks his clay by number, similar in fashion to the Composition C line of explosives:\n\nC1: Deidara's weakest explosive, these most often take the form of birds or insects. They are usually kept at a small size, making them ideal for sneak attacks or other covert operations.[2] C1 is produced using one of the mouths in Deidara's palms.[11]\nC2: a large, flight-capable dragon. Deidara rides atop it while it fires \"smart bombs\", smaller dragons that pursue their targets. The dragon also produces clay mines, which are used to force opponents to fight in a limited space.[2] C2 is produced using both of the mouths in Deidara's palm.[12]\nC3: a roughly human-shaped statue that Deidara drops on targets from above. They are designed to specifically maximise their destructive power, which is supposed to be great enough to destroy an entire village.[2]\nC4: a giant doll, shaped like Deidara himself. When it ruptures, it releases a cloud of microscopic bombs, too small to be seen. When these bombs are inhaled, they flood the victim's bloodstream and detonate, destroying them at a cellular level.[2] C4 is created using Deidara's normal mouth.[13]\nC0: Deidara's \"Ultimate Art\" (\u7a76\u6975\u82b8\u8853, Ky\u016bkyoku Geijutsu). Deidara draws in chakra from every corner of his body to turn himself into a bomb. Everything within ten kilometres is destroyed, but Deidara dies in the process. C0 is created using the mouth on Deidara's chest, which is connected directly to his heart.[14]\nTrivia[]\nKatsu (\u559d) is a type of shout that is used in Zen Buddhism to stop the discursive thoughts of practitioners, potentially helping them achieve an enlightenment experience. It is also used as a means of focusing energy.\nIn the English dub, Deidara's cry of \"katsu\" is omitted with a mere grunt instead.\nNaruto referred to the Explosive Clay as a kinjutsu of Iwagakure.[15]\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sh\u014d no Sho, page 10\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 Sha no Sho, pages 244-245\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 359, page 6\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 105\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 248, page 3\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 249, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 356, pages 9-10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 249, page 2\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 361, page 4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 361, pages 13-14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 357, pages 10-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 357, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 359, pages 16-17\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 262\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 78"},

The Nine-Tails itself is separated from the rest of this complex by a large cage; the bars of the cage are far enough apart for Naruto to walk between them,[11] but the Nine-Tails can only fit part of its claws through.[12] The cage's doors are secured by a sheet of parchment with \"seal\" (\u5c01) written on it, behind which is the cage's lock.[13] When the Nine-Tails sends its chakra to Naruto, a dark liquid leaks out from the cage towards him.[12]\n\n     Naruto preparing the key to the seal.  \nBecause the seal itself would naturally weaken over time, Minato created a key for it that can strengthen the seal when needed.

They then spin rapidly, repelling the attack (and anything else in the vicinity) away and creating a protective shield for as long as they continue to spin.[4] The greater the force of an attack, the greater the force with which it's repelled.[5] The user is capable of defending not only themselves but multiple people.[6]\nRevolving Heaven is meant to compensate for the blindspot of the Hy\u016bga's Byakugan.[7] But in this regard it is quite effective, leading Tenten to describe it as an absolute defence superior to the Shield of Sand.[4] While normally a short-range manoeuvre, with greater skill one can increase both the range and momentum of the rotating chakra shield as Hiashi Hy\u016bga can repel attackers from several feet away and did so with such force that it ploughed the ground around him, cratering the terrain he was on save for the location he was standing at.[8] The only effective means of countering the Revolving Heaven is to prevent the Hy\u016bga from spinning;[9] the anime sometimes depicts it being used without spinning.[10]\n\nTrivia[]\n\"Kaiten\" (\u56de\u5929, literally meaning: revolving heaven) is a term used to refer to turning the tides or fighting back up from a weak position. When written as \"\u56de\u8ee2\" (kaiten), it means \"revolving\" or \"spinning\".\nIn the anime, Revolving Heaven is shown to reach speeds of at least about 1200 km/h (745.6 mph). If an opponent can exceed this speed in the direction of the rotation, they can breach the defence.[11]\nIn the anime, if the user does not have focus and precise chakra control when the Revolving Heaven is executed, the user will repel themselves out of the technique.[12]\nIn the anime, the Genjutsu World's Hinata Hy\u016bga can use this technique.[13]\nSee Also[]\nProtecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Rin no Sho, page 216\n\n\u2191 Hy\u014d no Sho, page 29\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shipp\u016b Ranbu\n\n\u2191 4.0 4.1 Naruto chapter 101, pages 7-8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 104, pages 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto Shipp\u016bden Episode 184\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 195, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 137, page 9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 195, page 4\n\n\u2191 Naruto episode 61\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 377\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 380\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 428"},

It is essentially a seventh step to the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms, doubling the previous barrage total and at twice the speed.

This adds another row of kanji to the envisioned Eight Trigrams symbol, extending the technique's perimeter. This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through one hundred and twenty-eight chakra points of an opponent's Chakra Pathway System. This eliminates their ability to use chakra for quite some time and makes it difficult for them to move. Alternatively, it can be used to hit a great number of targets very quickly.\nOnce someone is within range of the user's field of divination, they assume a Gentle Fist stance and begin to deliver the attack:\n\nFirst, two consecutive strikes to make two.\nSecond, another two consecutive strikes to make four.\nThird, four consecutive strikes to make eight.\nFourth, eight consecutive strikes to make sixteen.\nFifth, sixteen consecutive strikes to make thirty-two.\nSixth, thirty-two consecutive strikes to make sixty-four.\nSeventh, sixty-four consecutive strikes in succession to make a total of one hundred and twenty-eight strikes."},

{"jutsu_name": "Eight Gates", "jutsu_type": "", "jutsu_description": "The Eight Gates are eight specific tenketsu along the chakra pathway system.[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n\n1.1 Gates\n\n\n2 Trivia\n3 See Also\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nThe Eight Gates exist in order to limit the flow of chakra within an individual's body. Normally, individuals can use no more than 20% of their body's full potential, the brain's way of protecting the individual from harming their body through overexertion. With training, individuals can learn to remove these limiters, referred to as \"opening\" the gates.[2] With each opened gate, individuals are given access to more and more of their body's chakra, thus increasing their physical strength and speed.[1] Ninja able to open the Eight Gates have existed since at least the time of Madara Uchiha.[3] Since Madara's era, there have only been a few known users:\n\nMight Duy learned to open all Eight Gates after twenty years of extensive training.[4]\nMight Guy, Duy's son, was taught how to open all Eight Gates by his father.[4]\nRock Lee, Guy's student, was taught how to open some of the Eight Gates by Guy. During Part I, he's able to open the first five gates.[1] By Part II, he's able to open the sixth gate.[5] By adulthood, Lee had mastered all eight gates.[6]\nIn The Last: Naruto the Movie, Rock Lee and the Suicide Corps could open the Sixth Gate to use a collaboration technique called the Crane Wing Formation.\nIn the anime, Metal Lee, Rock Lee's son, is shown subconsciously opening the first gate.[7]\nKakashi Hatake is seemingly able to open the first gate, as seen when he activates it during a Cliff Climbing Practice.[8] The anime later shows him opening it explicitly.[9]\nLearning to open any of the Eight Gates is apparently very difficult, as Kakashi is surprised when he's told that Lee - only thirteen years old at the time - can open five gates; Kakashi notes that such an accomplishment is impossible through hard work alone. Part of Kakashi's surprise is also because he does not believe it was wise for Guy to teach Lee to open the gates in the first place: although opening the gates does briefly give the user power greater than what they're normally capable of, this increased power causes the user serious harm.[1] At a minimum, the user will be fatigued, which can leave them vulnerable to attack if this occurs during combat.[2] In more extreme cases, muscles can tear and bones can break from the strain, which can be treated with medical ninjutsu.[10] When opening the eighth and final gate, users will die as a consequence, their bodies being unable to survive the immense amounts of chakra flowing through them.[1]\nUsing the Eight Gates is described as a double-edged sword,[1] empowering users by sacrificing their own health and safety; such risks have caused the Eight Gates to be likened to kinjutsu.[11] Because of this, Duy developed a self-rule to dictate when it was acceptable to open any of the Eight Gates, a rule he passed to Guy,[4] and that Guy subsequently passed to Lee: to only open the Eight Gates when protecting something that is precious enough to give one's life.[2] Often this \"precious something\" is a family member,[4] a loved one,[2] or a teammate.[12] Rock Lee has also been known to use the Eight Gates to defend his nind\u014d, the dream by which he leads his life.[13]\n\nGates[]\n    The Eight Gates.  \nWhen opening one of the Eight Gates, users are typically shown opening all preceding gates as well, though it is not clear if this is actually required. To have all of the Eight Gates open at once is known as Eight Gates Released Formation.[4]\n\nThe Gate of Opening (\u958b\u9580, Kaimon), located in the brain's left hemisphere, removes the user's mental inhibitions. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Front Lotus, a technique that tires them afterwards.[1]\nThe Gate of Healing (\u4f11\u9580, Ky\u016bmon, English TV: The Gate of Rest), located in the brain's right hemisphere, increases the user's physical strength. This has the added effect of re-energising the body, enabling it to rapidly recover from exhaustion.[1]\nThe Gate of Life (\u751f\u9580, Seimon), located on the spinal cord, turns the user's skin red when opened. Other effects include the user's pupils disappearing, their hair standing on end, and bulging veins all over their body. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Reverse Lotus.[1] In the anime, the chakra released is enough to create a buffer zone to allow safe passage through severe adverse weather.[14]\nThe Gate of Pain (\u50b7\u9580, Sh\u014dmon) is located on the spinal cord. Rock Lee opens this gate as he's about to use the Reverse Lotus, seemingly to increase his speed; as he performs the Reverse Lotus, his muscles start to tear. Opening the gate on this occasion also causes Lee's nose to start bleeding.[1]\nThe Gate of Limit (\u675c\u9580, Tomon, English TV: The Gate of Closing) is located in the abdomen. Rock Lee opens this gate as he's about to deliver the final blow of the Reverse Lotus,[1] seemingly to increase his strength; after completing the Reverse Lotus, Lee's limbs receive compound fractures.[15]\nThe Gate of View (\u666f\u9580 , Keimon, English TV: The Gate of Joy), located in the stomach, increases all the user's abilities.[16] The power that emanates from the user is enough to displace surrounding bodies of water.[12] Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Morning Peacock, wherein the user's punches are so fast that friction with the air produces flames.[16] Opening this gate has sometimes been shown to create an aura around the user;[5] in the anime, the aura is green.\nThe Gate of Wonder (\u9a5a\u9580, Ky\u014dmon, English TV: The Gate of Shock), located below the stomach, causes the user's body to secrete a blue sweat. The sweat immediately evaporates, creating an aura around the user that can be mistaken for chakra. Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Daytime Tiger, a single punch that creates a pocket of compressed air.[17] After opening this gate, Guy's muscle fibers rupture, causing him intense pain if anyone touches him.[18]\nThe Gate of Death (\u6b7b\u9580, Shimon) is located at the heart. Users open this gate by puncturing their chest with their thumb in order to direct the chakra there.[4] While open, the user's heart pumps at maximum speed, granting them power a hundred times greater than they are usually capable of, far beyond that of the Five Kage. A \"Steam of Blood\" (\u8840\u306e\u84b8\u6c17, Chi no J\u014dki) is emitted from the user's pores and hair, resembling a flaming red aura.[5] Opening this gate allows the user to perform the Evening Elephant and Night Guy. The eighth gate causes the body to continually heat up until it's been cooked from the inside-out, reducing the user to ash.[19]\nTrivia[]\n\n\nSpringtime of Youth\n\nThe Springtime of Youth wiki has an article about this topic:\nEight Gates\n\nThe Eight Gates are seemingly based off the real-life display of Hysterical Strength, in which a person pushes well-past their normal physical limits in moments of extreme desperation of life-or-death situations.\nAfter Might Guy opens all Eight Gates, he is saved from death by Naruto Uzumaki's Yin\u2013Yang Release.[19] However, damage done to his leg from using Night Guy leaves him wheelchair-bound for the rest of his life. Despite the handicap, Kakashi Hiden, Konoha Shinden, and the Boruto anime all show Guy continuing his life as a ninja as best as he can.\nIn Naruto Shipp\u016bden the Movie: Bonds, Shinn\u014d claims that his Body Revival Technique, combined with Dark Chakra, allows him to open all eight gates without any drawbacks.\nIn Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 and Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3, Neji Hy\u016bga uses Last Resort: Eight Gates Crumbling Attack to specifically block access to the Eight Gates.\nAccording to the official Naruto Twitter account, the manipulation of the Eight Gates is a secret taijutsu of Konohagakure.[20][21]\nSee Also[]\nAntlion Ninja Arts: Ephemeral\nPressure Points of Harm and Death\nSeven Heavens Breathing Method\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 Naruto chapter 85\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 Naruto chapter 52\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 667\n\n\u2191 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 Naruto chapter 668\n\n\u2191 5.0 5.1 5.2 Naruto chapter 669\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 70\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 70\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 93, pages 8-9\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 3\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 87\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 237\n\n\u2191 12.0 12.1 Naruto chapter 258\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 83\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 411\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 84\n\n\u2191 16.0 16.1 Sha no Sho, page 224\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 507\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 512\n\n\u2191 19.0 19.1 Naruto chapter 672, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 https://twitter.com/NARUTO_info_en/status/1827767902923317638\n\n\u2191 https://twitter.com/NARUTO_kousiki/status/1827888698228125941"},

{"jutsu_name": "Earth Grudge Fear", "jutsu_type": "Hiden, Ninjutsu, Kinjutsu", "jutsu_description": "The Earth Grudge Fear is a secret kinjutsu of Takigakure which transforms the user's body into something similar to that of a rag-doll, held together by hundreds of thick black threads. \n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Masks\n3 Trivia\n4 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nKakuzu, who stole the knowledge of this technique before his defection from Takigakure,[2] was able to manipulate black threads for many purposes. He was capable of sewing up any injuries that he or others might suffer, commonly by reattaching body parts; this ability seems to instantly reattach even nerves and muscles, as the patients could instantly move their limbs without any other complex procedures right away. However, it appears that this ability is somewhat limited, as he warned Hidan not to move his head too much after he had sewed it back on, saying that it might fall off again. He could detach parts of his limbs and then manipulate them, to the point that he could even send them underground and then reattach them when he was done with them.\nThe most significant aspect of these threads is that they granted Kakuzu a form of immortality, although he declined to think of it that way. In addition to sewing up his injuries, he could use the threads to tear into a victim's body, steal their still functioning organs, and integrate them into his own body, thus extending his life. Kakuzu usually used this method to steal hearts from powerful shinobi, and was able to store up to four spare hearts in his body at any given time, meaning that all hearts must stop functioning in order for Kakuzu to die. He can also put one of those hearts into his limbs and have them move individually, as seen when he used his hand to remove a shadow-enhanced  chakra blades that prevented the rest of his body from moving.\n\nMasks[]\n     Kakuzu with his heart constructs.  \nThe extra hearts in Kakuzu's body are normally stored in various animal masks that were sewn onto his back, granting him vast amounts of chakra and numerous elemental affinities. He could detach these masks and have them take on a body of their own, composed entirely of threads. Ino Yamanaka commented the masks gave off a bad chakra.[3] These masks were capable of attacking separately, unleashing devastating blasts of elemental chakra. These threads could also compact together to form a spider-like body around Kakuzu, allowing him to fuse the attacks of his masks together in order to increase his attacking power.\n\n     Kakuzu's masks: water (top-left), fire (top-right), lightning (bottom-left), and wind (bottom-right).  \nKakuzu's animal masks contained his spare hearts. If he took use of the heart for himself, the corresponding mask would shatter upon the creature's reentry into Kakuzu's body.\n\nFire mask: This heart had a fire-affinity, and took on the shape of a demonic tiger. It could use Fire Release: Intelligent Hard Work. This mask could also unite with the Wind mask to launch a fire-wind dual strike that was near unstoppable.\nLightning  mask: This heart had a lightning-affinity, and took on the shape of some sort of deformed bipedal. It could use Lightning Release: False Darkness.\nWater mask:[4] This heart had an water-affinity, and took on the shape of a demonic, beaked bipedal.[5] It allowed Kakuzu to use Water Release techniques, although they were not seen as the mask was destroyed before Kakuzu could use any.\nWind mask: This heart had a wind-affinity, and took on a strange four-legged body with thin wings. It could use Wind Release: Pressure Damage. It could unite with the Fire mask to launch a fire-wind dual strike that was near unstoppable.\nTrivia[]\nLike the rest of Kakuzu's techniques, the name of this techniques comes from the mecha anime Mobile Suit Gundam (\u6a5f\u52d5\u6226\u58eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0, Kid\u014d Senshi Gandamu). The name Jiongu was taken from the Mobile Suit MSN-02 Zeong (\u30b8\u30aa\u30f3\u30b0, Jiongu), a mecha that can detach its arms for ranged attacks, while still attached to the main body with wires. The name was altered slightly and given kanji to create the name of this technique.\nIn the manga, when Kakuzu is explaining his ability to store hearts, he is seen with a single horned mask on his back not matching the design of any of other masks.[6] The colour and element of this mask is unknown.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 263\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, pages 56-59\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 334, page 9\n\n\u2191 Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Ultimate Ninja Impact\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 528, page 17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 336, page 5, panel 1"},

The structure expands rapidly in size when being propelled towards its intended target and traps them inside its confines. The sphere then seems to explode with a tremendous amount of force, while the exterior walls of the structure effectively restrict the size of the blast radius, resulting in the destruction of everything and anyone caught within as they are pulverised into minute particles of dust. Because it attacks at a molecular level, there is no conventional defence against this technique.[1] The technique isn't limited to just affecting physical matter; it can also affect chakra-based defences, witnessed from \u014cnoki's use of it to destroy Madara Uchiha's Susanoo.[2]\n\n     Kak\u014d's large variant.  \nThe resulting damage that this technique can produce varies considerably, depending on the initial shape of the created structure. For example, when fabricated in the form of a cube, the structure possesses a relatively small blast radius, minimising the possibility for collateral damage. However, the conical version was implied to be enough to potentially destroy an entire island.[3] Additionally, it is possible to produce a much larger variant of the cube-shaped technique, which was large enough to destroy twenty-five Susanoo-clad wood clones in an instant. This cube can also be split into two after being activated, allowing for other techniques to be directed between the two halves.[4] When two similar techniques of approximately equal power collide, the pair merge into a single large spherical explosion; where everything caught within the substantial blast radius is completely pulverised.[5]\nKak\u014d has shown he could fire off the cubical version of the technique one-handed, which allows him for a rapid-fire attack (albeit the cubes do not expand upon release).[6]\n\nShape Variants[]\nThis technique can be manipulated into a diverse selection of three-dimensional structures, including cones, cylinders and cubes, with each retaining a sphere located at their centres. The size and length of it is proportional to the amount of chakra put into it.

Once latched on to the target's body and chakra network, the chains will use the tenketsu located at the navel to reach their way to the tailed beast and constrict their neck, pulling the beast from the inside of the jinch\u016briki. The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinch\u016briki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinch\u016briki's immobilisation and causing them pain. Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock. However, if another jinch\u016briki touches the chains, then their chakra will be drained for the duration of the physical contact.\nThe technique can be countered. Techniques that suppress chakra absorption such as a cocoon made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained. The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by closing the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.\nThere is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however. If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them. Despite that, the seal can be broken if all tenketsu of the target are blocked, after which they will still be in need for immediate treatment.\n\nTrivia[]\nThis technique is most likely named after a Japanese historical figure, known as Sen no Riky\u016b.\nSee Also[]\nAdamantine Sealing Chains\nDemonic Statue Chains"},

Haku creates several large mirrors out of ice, which he surrounds a target with.[1] By entering one of these mirrors,[2] Haku's reflection will appear in all of them. Haku can travel between these mirrors near-instantaneously, giving the appearance that he occupies all of them simultaneously. As such, any attacks he makes from these mirrors - usually rapid volleys of thrown senbon - can overwhelm opponents, seemingly coming from every mirror at once.[1] Using the technique requires a great deal of chakra from Haku, meaning he cannot use it indefinitely.[3] In the anime, if the mirror the user is in is broken, they can leap out of one of the fragments and continue their attack or move to another mirror.[4]\nAlthough Haku moves between the mirrors extremely quickly, to the point that Rin no Sho describes it as light speed,[1] it is still possible to track him: Sasuke Uchiha, with his undeveloped Sharingan, becomes able to follow his movements, and with enough time could even attack Haku;[3] Naruto Uzumaki, after entering an initial jinch\u016briki form, is able to dodge Haku as well.[5] Similarly, although the mirrors are quite resilient, notably not melting against standard Fire Release,[6] Naruto's jinch\u016briki form is strong enough to shatter one.[5] The mirrors will also shatter if Haku stops maintaining them.[7]\nThese exceptions aside, the Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals is still a formidable technique. Most victims will be unable to do anything against Haku's attacks, as they are so fast and come from so many directions at once that it's impossible to see all of them. If they should try to attack Haku while he's within a mirror, he can simply move to another mirror before they've even noticed.[1] If Haku completely surrounds his victims with mirrors, such as the dome he uses against Sasuke, then they are effectively trapped; only allies working from outside the dome stand a reasonable chance of saving them.[6] Even targets who manage to keep their distance from Haku are not safe, as he can simply form a mirror next to them, allowing him to quickly travel to and attack them.[8]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe full name of this technique is \"Secret Technique: Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals\" (\u79d8\u8853\u30fb\u9b54\u93e1\u6c37\u6676, Hijutsu: Maky\u014d Hy\u014dsh\u014d).\nThe technique specific seal for this jutsu closely resembles the hand seal for the real life Kuji-in seal of Py\u014d (\u5175) which has the middle fingers hooked over the index fingers and touching, the only difference being that the remaining four fingers are curled inward with the fingernails not showing.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Rin no Sho, page 221\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 24\n\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 27, pages 4-5\n\n\u2191 Naruto episode 17\n\n\u2191 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 28\n\n\u2191 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 25\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 524\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 521, pages 11-12"},

For instance, the tune played with Tayuya's right index and ring fingers and left middle and pinky fingers causes the shirtless Doki to bend forward.[2]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe name of this technique is a pun on \"armament\" (\u6b66\u88c5, bus\u014d) and \"sonata\" (\u594f\u66f2, s\u014dkyoku).\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 T\u014d no Sho, page 275\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 208"},
{"jutsu_name": "Delicate Illness Extraction Technique", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, Medical Ninjutsu", "jutsu_description": "When a person has been afflicted by a pathogen or toxin, this medical ninjutsu can be used to draw out the agent and heal the damage. The cause of the illness is first determined by perceiving disturbances in the patient's chakra. Then, using a chakra scalpel, an incision is made near the affected part. Using their chakra, the medical-nin pushes a large volume of a medicinal fluid through the incision. The fluid then draws the poison out of the affected part(s) and serves as a medium through which the poison is suspended and then forced out of the person's body. This technique thus removes the poison, while simultaneously repairing the damage caused by the poison. The process itself is extremely painful and requires the subject to be restrained in order for the process to work. As such, it is considered a rather crude method to deal with pathogens and toxins, and only used in emergency. This technique only draws out most of the poison, not all of it, so the subject can potentially still be in danger, albeit not immediate. To fully treat the subject, an antidote is needed.\nAfter the agent is drawn out, it can be used to create an antidote or medicine after it has been analysed. This can then be given to the patient to ensure a complete recovery. This technique requires the utmost care and ability in diagnosis, incising and unmatched chakra control. Therefore, it is considered an extremely difficult technique, even among medical-nin.\n\nTrivia[]\nIn the anime, Sarada Uchiha, Inojin Yamanaka, Wasabi Izuno, D\u014dshu Goetsu, Hako Kuroi, and Iwabee Yuino were each taught the basics of this Antidote Jutsu.[2]\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 256\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 152"},

{"jutsu_name": "Dead Demon Consuming Seal", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, F\u016binjutsu, Kinjutsu", "jutsu_description": "The Dead Demon Consuming Seal is a sealing technique developed by the Uzumaki clan to call upon the power of the Shinigami.[2] Its very existence is so secret that even Orochimaru knew nothing about it.[1]\n\nOverview[]\nAfter the hand seals are performed, the user's soul is partly separated from their body and suspended behind them. Behind their soul appears the Shinigami, which restrains their soul with its hair. Only the summoner is able to see the Shinigami at this point. After a few moments,[3] the Shinigami wraps its left arm with prayer beads and chants unintelligibly until a cursed seal appears on its arm. It then drives its arm into the summoner's soul, thus allowing the summoner to call upon the Shinigami to seal a target: the Shinigami's arm emerges from the summoner's body and grasps the target's soul.[1] When Hiruzen Sarutobi performs it, he is required to get close to his target in order to initiate the seal.[3] When Minato Namikaze performs it, he is able to remain at a distance.[4] Targets are able to see the Shinigami so long as it's in contact with their soul.[5]\nWhile the Shinigami grabs their soul, the target is immobilised, any jutsu they may be using are dispelled,[3] and they are prevented from performing additional jutsu.[5] With targets unable to escape or fight back, the summoner can remove and seal their soul. Hiruzen was able to seal multiple souls by using this technique in conjunction with the Shadow Clone Technique.[3] The sealing, however, is not necessarily complete nor automatic:\n\nWhen Minato uses it, he seals only the Nine-Tails' yin chakra, leaving its yang chakra alone.[6]\nWhen Hiruzen used it on Orochimaru, he had to rely on his own physical strength to extract Orochimaru's soul.[5] Because he lacked the strength to fully remove it,[7] he opted instead to only seal Orochimaru's arms, accomplished by having the Shinigami cut off the arms of Orochimaru's soul.[8]\nThe target's soul is sealed within the body of the summoner, represented by a swirl pattern on their torso that is similar in appearance to the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style.[3] In Minato's case, this sealing of the Nine-Tails' yin chakra into himself makes him its jinch\u016briki.[9] With the sealing completed, the Shinigami gradually starts consuming the summoner's soul.[8] The summoner can, with difficulty, continue moving and speaking, allowing them to finish any lingering business they may have, but they will die as soon as their soul has been fully consumed.[4] The souls of the summoner and their victim do not pass on to the Pure Land,[10] instead being trapped within the Shinigami's stomach, destined to fight each other for all eternity.[5]\nAlthough Orochimaru survives the sealing of his arms, his arms are paralysed, causing them to hang uselessly at his sides. This prevents him from performing hand seals and by extension most ninjutsu.[8] With time, he's able to regain limited use of the arms, but he's still left with a constant and extreme pain.[11] Orochimaru believes that Tsunade could heal his arms - something Tsunade does not deny - but she refuses to help him.[12] Ultimately, after his arms begin to rot, Orochimaru is forced to switch bodies or risk death.[13] He is able to make better use of the new body's arms,[14] but the jutsu he can use remain limited so long as his soul's arms are sealed within the Shinigami.[15]\n\n    Souls being released from the Shinigami's stomach.  \nSouls can only be freed from the Shinigami's stomach by using Dead Demon Consuming Seal: Release (\u5c4d\u9b3c\u5c01\u5c3d\u30fb\u89e3, Shiki F\u016bjin: Kai, English TV: Reaper Death Seal: Release). To use, an individual wears the Shinigami Mask, causing them to become possessed by the Shinigami. If the individual wearing the mask slices open their own stomach, the Shinigami will do the same, and any souls inside it will be freed. However, the mask doesn't have any properties that will prevent its user from dying of that injury; when Orochimaru uses this to restore his arms, he survives the injury by switching bodies once again. With the other souls he frees from the Shinigami, Orochimaru is able to use the Impure World Reincarnation.[15]\n\nTrivia[]\nThe full name of this technique is \"Sealing Technique: Dead Demon Consuming Seal\" (\u5c01\u5370\u8853\u30fb\u5c4d\u9b3c\u5c01\u5c3d, F\u016binjutsu: Shiki F\u016bjin).\nT\u014d no Sho lists the Dead Demon Consuming Seal as having a range of up to five meters.[1] When Minato uses it against the Nine-Tails, he does so from significantly further away.[4]\nDuring his discussion with Kushina on how to deal with the Nine-Tails, Minato stated: \"The f\u016binjutsu I \u2014 not being a jinch\u016briki \u2014 am able to use is\u2026 the Dead Demon Consuming Seal!\" (\u300c\u4eba\u67f1\u529b\u3067\u306a\u3044\u30aa\u30ec\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u5c01\u5370\u8853\u306f\u5c4d\u9b3c\u5c01\u5c3d!\u300d, \"Jinch\u016briki denai ore ga dekiru f\u016binjutsu wa Shiki F\u016bjin!\").[6] What he meant by this is unclear.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 T\u014d no Sho, page 228\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 619, page 2\n\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 Naruto chapter 123\n\n\u2191 4.0 4.1 4.2 Naruto chapter 504\n\n\u2191 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 Naruto chapter 124\n\n\u2191 6.0 6.1 Naruto chapter 503, page 17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 136\n\n\u2191 8.0 8.1 8.2 Naruto chapter 137\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 631\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 520, pages 11-12\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 153\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 155\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 198, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 295\n\n\u2191 15.0 15.1 Naruto chapter 618"},

The seal was applied on the left side of the back of both Sasuke's and Anko's necks.\nAnko received her cursed seal when she was a student of Orochimaru. She, along with nine others, were the first people to receive a cursed seal. She was the only one to survive the application, establishing the one-in-ten success rate for the procedure. Because she lacked the will to use it, her seal receded, and (in the anime) Orochimaru wiped her memory. Orochimaru was able to briefly reactivate the seal when they fought in the Forest of Death before the Third Hokage sealed it off again. It was fully removed when Sasuke used it as a medium to revive Orochimaru's consciousness and body via the Evil Releasing Method.[2]\n\n     Sasuke receives curse seal.  \nOrochimaru branded Sasuke with the cursed seal in the second phase of the Ch\u016bnin Exams, which took place in the Forest of Death. Orochimaru intended to have the seal corrode Sasuke's mind so that he could become his next body. Kakashi Hatake used the Evil Sealing Method to try and prevent this, but its effectiveness relied on Sasuke's choosing not to use his cursed seal. Sasuke ultimately chose to advance his seal to its second level, and went to Orochimaru with the help of the Sound Four. \nWhen Sasuke activated the second level of the seal, his skin turned dark-grey and his hair grew and turned dark blue. His eyes also turned dark grey. Additionally, he grew webbed-claw-shaped wings from his back which he could use to fly and glide, and a dark, star-shaped mark appeared across the bridge of his nose. Should any limbs be lost, Sasuke is able to replace them with snakes. During Sasuke's battle with Itachi Uchiha, he lost the cursed seal, along with Orochimaru (having earlier been absorbed into Sasuke's body), as they were removed with the Sword of Totsuka.\nAccording to Kabuto, the seal itself contains Orochimaru's chakra, which Kabuto used in order to improve the binding power of Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation. In fact, when Orochimaru was defeated, his consciousness remained split amongst the cursed seals, and Sasuke used that, along with a piece of Kabuto's modified flesh, to bring the former back to his original state and mind.[2]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 199, pages 2-3\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 593, page 9"},

The seal is located on the upper portion of Kimimaro's chest over his manubrium. When the first level is activated, the seal turns orange-red and expands in lines spreading all over Kimimaro's body in contorting and parallel lines. When the second level of the seal is active, Kimimaro takes on a dinosaur-like appearance complete with a tail. Several large bones also protrude from his darkened skin and gains four distinguishing figures: two dark black curved like markings under his eyes - one under each eye and two as elongated eyebrows - one above each eye.\n\nUsage[]\nThis cursed seal is particularly strong even amongst the other already powerful cursed seals with Kimimaro being the only known user and with the Cursed Seal of Heaven standing as its only equal. Like all cursed seals, Kimimaro receives increased chakra levels, physical capabilities and his ninjutsu skills become more effective when the seal is active.

The other being him to acquire and ingest the blood of his intended victim. Once ingested, his skin then turns black with white markings which makes him look like a skeleton, a symbol of absolute death. This serves as the link between him and his victim. \nOnce his sacrificial ritual takes place, the victim's body is linked with Hidan's curse until he either steps or is forced out of the circle. Any kind of injury that Hidan inflicts upon himself (or the injury they inflicted on him) is reciprocated on his target, be it a mere scratch to a pierce in the heart. If Hidan is forced to step out of the circle, the link is temporarily broken and the victim is set free, but only as long as Hidan has stepped out of the circle's reach. Basically, this technique makes Hidan a living voodoo doll.\n\nTrivia[]\nHidan's immortality is due to the \"successful experiment of the Jashin religion's secret technique\", so he can fatally torture his opponents in any way he desires without killing himself, and he clearly enjoys the pain as well.

For this reason, most ninja cannot use the Chidori safely.[10] However, a user of the Sharingan can overcome these drawbacks due to its heightened visual perception preventing the tunnel vision from occurring and its predictive capabilities making it easier for the user to avoid counterattacks.[11] Hidari despite having a pair of Rinnegan finds using the jutsu hard to control, and believes the Sharingan is needed to master it.[12] Kakashi's skill with the Chidori eventually became so good that he was able to split a bolt of lightning with it, earning his Chidori the name \"Lightning Cutter\".[13]\nThe Chidori requires a large amount of chakra to be performed, placing a limit on how many times it can be used per day. In Part I, Kakashi can use it four times per day[14] and Sasuke Uchiha can use it twice per day under his own power.[15] Both increase their limits to an unspecified number in Part II. During Part II, Sasuke demonstrates several variations of the Chidori that have been given shape transformation, such as Chidori Senbon and Chidori Sharp Spear, both of which allow him to attack at a longer range than the Chidori is capable of.\n\nVariants[]\nSasuke has been shown using the Chidori with different chakra sources to grant his Chidori additional properties:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen drawing on the chakra of his Cursed Seal of Heaven, Sasuke uses a \"Flapping Chidori\" (\u7fbd\u6483\u304f\u5343\u9ce5, Habataku Chidori, English TV: Black Chidori, literally meaning: Flapping One Thousand Birds),[16] which is stronger, darker in colour, and sounds like flapping wings rather than chirping birds.[17] Different video games have called it \"Wailing Chidori\" (\u615f\u54ed\u306e\u5343\u9ce5, D\u014dkoku no Chidori, literally meaning: Wailing One Thousand Birds, Game translation: Chidori Lament) and \"Black Chidori\" (\u9ed2\u3044\u5343\u9ce5, Kuroi Chidori, literally meaning: Black One Thousand Birds). If accessed in his first state of the Cursed Seal, the Chidori is normally coloured purple instead in most forms of media.\n\n\n\n\nWhen imbued with the Six Paths Power, Sasuke's Chidori can be used to damage the Ten-Tails' jinch\u016briki, whose body is otherwise impervious to standard ninjutsu.[18] In Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, this is called \"Dark Chidori\" (\u9ed2\u304d\u5343\u9ce5, Kuroki Chidori, literally meaning: Dark One Thousand Birds, Game translation: Onyx Chidori).\n\n\n\n\nSasuke is briefly shown combining Chidori with Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi.[19] When it is clashed with Naruto Uzumaki's Rasengan, the resulting explosion destroys the statues at the Valley of the End and as well as both of their dominant arms.[20]\n\n\nTrivia[]\n\"Chidori\" (\u5343\u9ce5) can also be translated to \"plover\".\nThe name Chidori comes from a story about famous samurai Tachibana D\u014dsetsu: Tachibana was in possession of a famous sword called Chidori (\u5343\u9ce5, literally meaning: A Thousand Birds). One day, while he was still a young man, he was taking shelter under a tree, as it was raining. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck him. However, Tachibana used his Chidori to cut the Thunder God inside the lightning bolt, allowing him to survive. After this incident, he renamed his Chidori to Raikiri (\u96f7\u5207, literally meaning: Lightning Cutter).\nIn the original Naruto anime, Chidori looks like a white, sphere-shaped amount of electricity that surrounds the palm. This is corrected in the Naruto: Shipp\u016bden anime, where the Chidori is depicted as it is in the manga: a formless coverage of electricity all over the hand.\nHowever, in the video game J-Stars Victory Vs. and its + version, Sasuke's Chidori takes its incorrectly rendered sphere shape as aforementioned, but with the sphere contained within his hand (only during its startup animation and when Sasuke is running with the Chidori active).\nIn both Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2 and 3, players can customise some characters to be able to use Chidori. In the former case, it is called \"Young Lightning\" in the English script when used by Anbu Kakashi.\nAlso, in some forms of media like the aforementioned games (along with Naruto: Gekit\u014d Ninja Taisen! 4 and Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2), Sasuke in his Cursed Seal of Heaven state (both level 1 and 2) often has the ability to perform both the normal version of his Chidori and its Cursed Seal version as separate techniques.\nHowever, in Jump Super Stars, despite using the Cursed Seal Chidori in his State 2 form for his Battle 7 Koma, Sasuke's Chidori is coloured purple akin to the State 1 version instead of dark-white.\nIn the trailers for Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Lightning Release Bullet: Powerful Breath makes the unique sound that Chidori makes.\nSee Also[]\nDrilling Hand of Sage Lightning\nHell Stab\nLightning Flash Palm\nLightning Release: Purple Electricity\nNadeshiko-Style Hardliner Gale Fist\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 First Databook, page 209\n\n\u2191  Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 417\n\n\u2191 Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Volume 3's Sasuke's Profile\n\n\u2191 Naruto episode 134\n\n\u2191 Naruto episode 67\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 321\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 177, page 8\n\n\u2191 8.0 8.1 Naruto chapter 113, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 146, pages 13, 17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 240, page 14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 244, pages 4-6\n\n\u2191 Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 11, page 25\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 114, page 3\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 128, page 11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 128, page 9\n\n\u2191 Second Databook, page 51\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 232, pages 11-13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 674\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 698, page 3\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 698, page 6"},

For other uses, see Chibaku Tensei (disambiguation).\n\n\n\nChibaku Tensei is a technique used through the Deva Path of the Rinnegan.\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Video Games\n3 Trivia\n4 See Also\n5 References\n\n\nOverview[]\nUsers create a black sphere between their hands that they hurl into the sky. When the sphere is activated, it generates powerful attractive force, pulling everything in the vicinity to it until a large satellite is created;[2] users control how large the satellite becomes.[3] Creating a satellite apparently requires a great deal of chakra, such that Nagato, when attempting to use it through his Six Paths of Pain, must first bring the Deva Path close to his location so that he can channel his chakra to it more effectively, although it was done in his heavily exhausted state.[4]\nChibaku Tensei is most often used to restrain targets, drawing them in during the satellite's creation and trapping them beneath the mounds of rubble.[2] When used to capture tailed beasts, the resulting satellites are known as \"Tailed Beast Sealing Stones\" (\u5c3e\u7363\u5c01\u5370\u306e\u5ca9, Bij\u016b F\u016bin no Iwa).[5] Only Naruto Uzumaki, by entering a near-Tailed Beast Mode, has been known to break free from one.[3] Because of how difficult it is to escape from Chibaku Tensei, the best way to counter it is to destroy the black sphere early on in the formation process. In order to penetrate the initial layers of rubble, users should use their most powerful attacks, such as the Tailed Beast Ball or Wind Release: Rasenshuriken. Actually aiming at the black sphere is not really necessary, as all attacks will be pulled towards it.[6]\n\n     Sasuke's multiple Chibaku Tensei.  \nWhen performed by Sasuke Uchiha, he does not use the typical black sphere, instead gathering rubble around each of his immobilised targets;[7] this is similar to the Six Paths \u2014 Chibaku Tensei. Once the satellites are formed, Sasuke is able to move them remotely.[8] Madara Uchiha is also shown creating multiple satellites at a time, each with its own black sphere. Rather than use the satellites to restrain targets, Madara uses them as large projectiles that he drops on his opponents.[9]\n\nVideo Games[]\nChibaku Tensei is a common move in Naruto video games:\n\nIn Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Shinobi Rumble, Pain generates a moderately sized sphere of debris overhead, then thrusts his arms downward, sending it crashing into the ground like a meteor. In the game it is called \"Six Paths Technique\" rather than Chibaku Tensei. An enhanced, \"Full Throttle\" version of the technique called \"Six Paths Technique: Collapse\" (\u516d\u9053\u306e\u8853\u30fb\u5d29\u58ca, Rikud\u014d no Jutsu: H\u014dkai) can also be performed.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 2, Pain uses Chibaku Tensei to summon a whirlwind of boulders to protect himself against attacks. He can also launch the boulders individually as a form of attack.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Impact, Pain creates the planetary body and brings it down on his opponents. He also uses this as his Awakening, where he summons a whirlwind of boulders as a defensive system and an offensive system at the same time.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, Nagato uses this technique to imprison his opponent, and then fires a chakra blast which goes through its core, causing a massive explosion.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution, as part of Pain and Konan's collaboration, Pain uses this technique to trap his opponent and then Konan lines the debris with explosive tags. Konan then sends a single origami bird which causes a massive explosion.\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, Rinnegan Sasuke pierces the opponent with the black flames, traps him within Chibaku Tensei, and then destroys it with Chidori Kagutsuchi via his Complete Body \u2014 Susanoo. His The Last version also uses the technique as part of his Chidori: Star Crusher. And during the boss battle against Naruto and Sasuke, Madara is able to create a gargantuan version of Chibaku Tensei by merging multiple planetoids into one with the Wood Release.\nTrivia[]\nDespite Madara using this technique in the manga, he is not listed as a user in Jin no Sho.[1]\nSee Also[]\nBansh\u014d Ten'in\nShinra Tensei\nTengai Shinsei\nTrue: Chibaku Tensei\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Jin no Sho, pages 268-269\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 439, pages 1-7\n\n\u2191 3.0 3.1 Naruto chapter 440, page 2\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 438, page 17\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shipp\u016b Ranbu\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, pages 12-15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 692, pages 14-15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 696, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 676, pages 9-11"},

Ground that is affected by this jutsu fractures and sends small, flower petal-size particles into the air, hence the name.[1]\n\nTrivia[]\nTsunade does something similar using the tip of one of her fingers, creating a deep fissure in the earth when she strikes it.[3]\nIn the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, Sakura uses an advanced version of this technique called \"Full Bloom: Cherry Blossom Impact\" (\u6e80\u958b\u30fb\u685c\u82b1\u885d, Mankai: \u014ckash\u014d).\nIn Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker, Sarada Uchiha uses a slightly weaker variant called \"Crimson Drizzle\" (\u7d05\u6642\u96e8, Benishigure).\nSee Also[]\nHeavenly Foot of Pain\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Sha no Sho, page 227\n\n\u2191 Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Ultimate Ninja 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 159, pages 4-5"},

{"jutsu_name": "Chakra Transfer Technique", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu, Chakra Flow, Ninsh\u016b", "jutsu_description": "This technique allows the user to transfer their chakra to a target. The amount of chakra transferred depends solely on the user.\n\nOverview[]\nThis technique was originally created by Hagoromo \u014ctsutsuki in order to \"connect\" the spiritual energies of every living person. His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of ninsh\u016b, but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. \n\nVariations[]\nCertain people, such as\u00a0Minato Namikaze and Naruto Uzumaki could also mould the transferred chakra in order to adapt it to another person's specific chakra type.[1] In the latter's case, due to Kurama's chakra, it also enveloped the recipients in a chakra cloak similar to his \"Version 1\" form, albeit with no tails.[2] Once the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.\nKatsuyu and its summoners have a unique bond between them through Strength of a Hundred Seal and they can use Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing. Tsunade used this technique during Pain's invasion of Konoha, with Tsunade first transferring her healing chakra to Katsuyu, and then Katsuyu itself transferring it to the wounded villagers. Sakura used the same method of Tsunade with Katsuyu to heal wounded shinobi in Shinobi Alliance against Ten-Tails.[3]\nTsunade used again this technique during the five Kage's fight against Madara Uchiha to give \u014cnoki some of her chakra so that he could use a massive Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique to defeat Madara's wood clones.[4] Sakura later used this technique to improve Obito's Kamui.\nZetsu's Spore Technique creates clones, which feed on chakra to grow are also able to transfer chakra to people they come in contact with.[5]\nDan Kat\u014d was able to use this technique as a spirit in Tsunade's consciousness to restore her chakra and Strength of a Hundred Seal.[6] Obito did something similar to give his chakra and d\u014djutsu powers to Kakashi after his body had been turned to ashes.[7]\nJ\u016bgo was able to transfer natural energy to someone thanks to his clan's unique ability.[8][9]\nTailed beasts are also able to freely share their chakra with whoever they choose, and as Kurama has noted, it is a less complicated process for them than it is for humans.[10][11]\nSamehada was able to absorb and transfer chakra to its wielder. It was also able to transfer chakra from Kisame back to Killer B.[12][13]\nHagoromo \u014ctsutsuki was the first user of this technique to connect all humans living in the earth and gave the chakra to humanity besides his immediate family.[14] Hagoromo also used this technique inside of Naruto and Sasuke who are the reincarnations of Asura and Indra. He gave the power to them to defeat Madara. While using this technique, a unique entity appears behind Hagoromo with a marking reminiscent of a third eye in its forehead.[15]\nIn the anime, if the Aburame member has proper control, the kikaich\u016b are also shown able to transfer their accumulated chakra to others targets, replenishing them.[16]\nIn the anime, the Magaki Group uses this technique in a different way. First Nang\u014d sends his chakra to Benten and Ch\u016bshin, and then both of them send it along with its own to Akaboshi, greatly enhancing the power of his techniques.[17] He is able to shatter a barrier easily with his increased chakra.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 617, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 616\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 634, pages 7-8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 588, pages 13-15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 466, pages 9-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 591, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 688, page 2\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 413, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 618, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 572, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 609, pages 13-14\n\n\u2191 \"Naruto\" chapter 471, page 14\n\n\u2191 \"Naruto\" chapter 472, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 665, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 671, pages 14-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 304\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 144"},

Each is capable of tracking their intended target and producing a significant explosion proportional to size upon contact but as they emerge, they consume a substantial amount of clay from the original dragon, initially extracting it from the creature's tail. This ultimately limits the number that each C2 \"Dragon\" is capable of creating, before clay must be sacrificed from more vital areas, such as the body or wings.

To an observer, it appears as if the user has teleported. It is accomplished by using chakra to temporarily vitalise the body and move at extreme speeds. The amount of chakra required depends on the overall distance and elevation between the user and the intended destination.[1]\nA puff of smoke is occasionally used to disguise the user's movements. Other elements or substances can be used instead to distract the opponent: Gaara uses sand for the Sand Body Flicker (\u7802\u77ac\u8eab, Suna-Shunshin);[1] in Shikamaru Hiden, Sai uses ink for the Ink Mist Body Flicker (\u58a8\u971e\u77ac\u8eab, Sumigasumi-Shunshin). Villages can even have their own variants, as in the Mist Body Flicker (\u9727\u77ac\u8eab, Kiri-Shunshin), Water Body Flicker (\u6c34\u77ac\u8eab, Mizu-Shunshin), and Leaf Body Flicker (\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u77ac\u8eab, Konoha-Shunshin, literally meaning: Tree Leaf Body Flicker).[1]\nAlthough the Body Flicker Technique is common to almost all shinobi, some are particularly renowned for their usage of it. Shisui Uchiha was feared as \"Shisui of the Body Flicker\" (\u77ac\u8eab\u306e\u30b7\u30b9\u30a4, Shunshin no Shisui); whenever he employed this technique, Shisui would fade away from sight, leaving no trace of his presence. In the anime, Shisui was also able to generate clones through the technique. When the Third Raikage utilised the technique, it looked like a bolt of lightning appeared and disappeared from the area. The Fourth Raikage often combined the Body Flicker Technique with the Lightning Release Chakra Mode which allowed him to dodge Amaterasu.\n\nTrivia[]\nCertain space\u2013time ninjutsu are sometimes confused with the Body Flicker Technique, as it creates the illusion of the user instantly moving from one place to another. However, whereas space\u2013time ninjutsu actually transport the user through space, this technique is merely high-speed movement.[2] Despite this, the Flying Thunder God Technique is regularly called the \"Body Flicker Technique\" by various individuals, including the technique's creator.[3][4]\nFurther confusion exists in some translations of the series. In Viz's English translations, the Body Flicker Technique is called \"Teleportation\", whereas space\u2013time ninjutsu are generally referred to as \"Transportation Techniques\".\nThe Body Flicker Technique is similar to Swift Release, a kekkei genkai that allows the user to move at high speeds.\nSee Also[]\nSwift Release: Shadowless Flight\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Rin no Sho, page 197\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 395, page 9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 240, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 637, page 14"},

They are durable enough to break steel scalpels,[21] as well as sharp enough to pierce through human bodies with ease.[22] Though durable, the rods can still be destroyed when struck with sufficient force,[23] and their creator is able to break them apart without any apparent difficulty.[24] Once formed, the user can transmit chakra to these receivers from across vast distances, though for best results, they must be nearby and at a high elevation.[25] Though chakra being sent to these receivers can be sensed, a skilled user can prevent their location from being discovered by constantly changing the frequency of their chakra.[26] Offensively employing receivers from afar carries a risk, as those with sensing capabilities can trace the transmitted chakra back to the user when pierced with one.[27] When receiving chakra, the black rods noticeably heat up.[11]\n\n     The user transmits chakra into the victim's body.  \nBy stabbing an opponent with the rods, the user can transmit their chakra into the target's body, disrupting their own chakra and throwing off their movements.[28][29] The user can fully immobilise the target by stabbing them with multiple rods,[24] as well as prevent them from moulding additional chakra by piercing their tenketsu.[8] Provided the user is close enough, they can potentially control the target's movements, though this can be resisted if the target's own chakra is powerful enough.[30] Aside from being stabbed, simply touching the receivers can apparently also incur negative effects,[8] though Rinnegan wielders are seemingly immune.[31]\nChakra receivers are also used to control the Six Paths of Pain: six reanimated corpses that possess copies of the Rinnegan, granting them a shared field of vision with their creator. Nagato controlled his Six Paths of Pain using numerous receivers fashioned into piercings, which were implanted all about their bodies,[32] whereas Obito had a single rod implanted in each body's chest.[33] Among other Rinnegan abilities, the bodies are capable of producing additional rods to serve as weapons.[34] As they are controlled by the user's chakra, opponents can prevent these bodies from moving by removing all of their receivers.[35] The receivers implanted in Obito's Six Paths of Pain doubled as a means of temporarily binding the chakra of the tailed beasts sealed inside the Demonic Statue to their bodies, making them into jinch\u016briki.[36] When they entered Tailed Beast Mode, the receivers would relocate from the jinch\u016briki's chests up to the tailed beasts' necks.[37] The creatures Nagato summoned through the Animal Path were also embedded with numerous receivers, suggesting he controlled them in a similar manner.\n\n     Chakra chains manifested through giant stakes.  \nWhen employed offensively, the black rods make for effective weapons. They can emerge from the user's hand to stab opponents,[38] be broken off and wielded like swords,[39] or be launched as high-speed projectiles,[40] and the size and shape of the generated receivers can be adjusted to fit the situation.[22] Obito is shown employing black receivers fashioned into giant stakes as projectiles, ejecting them from Kamui's dimension to pierce and pin targets.[41] He can also manifest chakra chains to bind those touching the receivers with an even greater binding power.[42] In the anime, the user can also apply shape transformation to the rods after launching them, altering them into more elaborate forms.[43]\nBlack receivers disintegrate when their creator is killed or similarly incapacitated, alongside any Truth-Seeking Balls they may possess.[44][40]\n\nTrivia[]\nObito implied the binding power of the black rods is related to the Outer Path.[42] However, Madara was able to use their binding power even after losing his Rinnegan.[10]\nSimilar to Truth-Seeking Balls, black receivers appear to hinder the regenerative qualities of Impure World Reincarnation to some extent, as the wounds of reincarnated individuals do not immediately heal while the rods are pierced through their bodies,[45] though they do eventually heal.[31]\nNaruto Uzumaki used something similar to black receivers when he shaped his Truth-Seeking Balls into rods and used them to immobilise Madara and Black Zetsu.[46][47]\nIn Naruto Shipp\u016bden: Shinobi Rumble, Pain's Black Needle Stab temporarily reverses the controls of those stabbed by his black rods.\nIsshiki \u014ctsutsuki has employed similar tools; however, they're different in that Isshiki has no Rinnegan, and they function differently. His absorb chakra instead of transmitting his own to disrupt the chakra of those it pierces.[48]\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Jin no Sho, page 255\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 420, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 420, page 16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 428, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 436, page 3\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 565, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 569, page 5\n\n\u2191 8.0 8.1 8.2 Naruto chapter 661, page 11\n\n\u2191 9.0 9.1 Naruto chapter 606, page 16\n\n\u2191 10.0 10.1 Naruto chapter 657, page 5\n\n\u2191 11.0 11.1 Naruto chapter 420, pages 15-16\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 647, pages 8-9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 512, pages 8-9\n\n\u2191 Jin no Sho, page 247\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 447, pages 8-13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 605, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 636, pages 15-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 656, pages 16-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 643, pages 9-11\n\n\u2191 Boruto: Naruto the Movie novelisation, chapter 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 418, page 14\n\n\u2191 22.0 22.1 Naruto chapter 381, page 1\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 433, page 7\n\n\u2191 24.0 24.1 Naruto chapter 437, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 436, pages 3-4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 435, pages 11-12\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 441, pages 12-15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 381, page 3\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 420, pages 8-9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 444, pages 3-4\n\n\u2191 31.0 31.1 Naruto chapter 673, page 9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 421, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 565, pages 9-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 378, page 1\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 443, pages 3-4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 570, page 4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 569, pages 5-6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 636, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 442, pages 7-9\n\n\u2191 40.0 40.1 Boruto: Naruto the Movie\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 598, pages 9-10\n\n\u2191 42.0 42.1 Naruto chapter 569, page 10\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 135\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 680, pages 10-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 661, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 675, pages 10-11\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 688, page 6\n\n\u2191 Boruto chapter 36, page 34"},

Because there is even more chakra being compressed to a higher density, the ball releases its energy immediately on contact, thus increasing its destructive power beyond the Rasengan's.[1] In the anime, it is noted that one requires immense amounts of chakra to create a Big Ball Rasengan at all.[3]\nWhen Naruto first starts using the Big Ball Rasengan, he needs a shadow clone to help him form and wield it.[4] He is able to wield it with one hand when his skill with it improves, though he still needs a clone's help in its formation.[5]\n\nUsage and Improvement[]\nLike the original Rasengan, Naruto improved the Big Ball Rasengan and created a variant with his Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. The size and power of his Big Ball Rasengan also improved, with it growing to nearly half the size of the Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan.[5] He can also add Wind Release to it, to create the Big Ball Rasenshuriken.[6]\n\nSenjutsu Influence[]\n    Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan.  \nWhen in Sage Mode, Naruto can use a senjutsu-enhanced version known as Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan (\u4ed9\u6cd5\u30fb\u5927\u7389\u87ba\u65cb\u4e38, Senp\u014d: \u014cdama Rasengan, English TV: Sage Art: Giant Rasengan). As with the original, Naruto uses a shadow clone to help him form the ball. With this senjutsu version, however, he can have a shadow clone form a Big Ball Rasengan in each of his hands, which he can then pass to the clones for them to wield. The Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan is much larger than the original, almost being as big as Pain's summons.[7]\n\n\nTrivia[]\nMinato Namikaze could use this technique in Jiraiya's novel within Tsunade's Infinite Tsukuyomi dream.[8]\nBy the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto's regular Rasengan had increased to near Big Ball Rasengan size.\nWhen Konohamaru used this technique in an OVA, he was able to use it with one hand.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Third Databook, page 228\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 188\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 168\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 260, page 10\n\n\u2191 5.0 5.1 Naruto chapter 561, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 655, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 431, page 10\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 441"},

His whisker markings become thicker, with the upper ones on each side curving up below his eyes. The pigments around his eyes become black and stretch up towards his makeshift fox ears, and he takes on Kurama's red-slit eyes. The colouring of his clothes turns slightly darker orange, and he gains a chakra cape with a black swirl in the middle of his chest. Flowing from the back of his cape are four orange (red in the anime) chakra tails, with five more at the end of the cape; each tail has a black line down the centre that connects in the middle of the cape as a swirl.\nIn a process similar to nuclear fusion, Naruto's and Kurama's chakra are consumed as raw materials to produce a new type of energy. The increase in chakra was enough to shock both Isshiki and Sasuke, with the latter noting it being tremendous. When in use, it dramatically boosts Naruto's reflexes, speed, and power to such extremes that he even surpasses Isshiki's capabilities, allowing him to snatch the \u014ctsutsuki's black rods out of the air before they are visibly enlarged, as well as dodge and effortlessly parry attacks.[2] Kurama notes that because all chakra is connected, contact with an opponent will drain their lifespan as well.[2]\n\nDrawbacks[]\nAs powerful as Baryon Mode is, it is extremely dangerous if used for too long or recklessly, making this form a \"double-edged sword\". Doing so will gradually drain at the user's strength and very lifespan. Because of the extreme risk, the user must not make any unnecessary movements, nor act on any stray thoughts, focusing on only the most calculated of moves to keep Baryon Mode stable. Even more, over-usage of this form comes at an even greater risk at Kurama's life altogether, effectively killing it. Upon reaching the breaking point, Kurama's entire being will be destroyed, depriving Naruto of all the kitsune's chakra and capacities. However, the removal of Kurama from its jinch\u016briki will not endanger the latter's life. Despite his death, Kurama was eventually revived as with any Tailed Beasts who would die, albeit not within Naruto.\n\nTrivia[]\nBaryons are heavy subatomic particles that are composed of three quarks. The most common examples are protons and neutrons, which are the particles that undergo fusion in the Sun.\nBaryon Mode seems to embody the Will of Fire, with Naruto's chakra cloak incorporating the symbol and strongly resembling the monument in the Konoha Cemetery. It also resembles Kushina's hair when she's angry, getting into her \"Red Hot-Blooded Habanero\" moniker.\nSee Also[]\nEight Gates Released Formation\nNine-Tails Chakra Mode\nNinja Art Creation Rebirth \u2014 Strength of a Hundred Technique\nSix Paths Sage Mode\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Boruto Database: Baryon Mode\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Boruto chapter 52"},

Should the need arise, the toad can be used to transport whatever it has captured, releasing its contents when given the command.\nThe environment inside the toad's stomach is a cavernous chamber, which includes a lake of strong corrosive gastric acid that can dissolve anything that should happen to fall into it, along with shores around the acid lake, and rock formations sticking out of the lake; the already-existing structures within the Toad's stomach are seemingly unaffected by the acid lake. Once trapped inside, an opponent is cut off from any allies and susceptible to attack, and can then be easily defeated.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 253"},

Even if the tags are discovered, actually disarming them is very difficult, for which reason it's generally safer to simply avoid the area.[1] Shikaku Nara once forced his son, Shikamaru, to read a book that discussed this technique, which described it as \"a high-class ninjutsu\".[2]\n\nTrivia[]\nIn Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution, String Light Formation is incorrectly named as this technique.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 T\u014d no Sho, page 220\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 185"},

These additional appendages, as well as the user's body as a whole, are augmented with a variety of mechanical weaponry, which they can access at will. The user can fire their forearms as long-range projectiles or pull them off to reveal and fire a cluster of segmented missiles at targets. They are also able to protrude a set of flexible blades and drills or a series of mechanical tendrils from their arms, as well as quickly propel themselves forward by emitting a burst of chakra from holes in their feet. The user can also release a powerful chakra blast, which is capable of destroying numerous buildings at once, either by transforming one of their hands into a cannon or by opening the crown of their head.\nThe body through which Nagato channelled the Asura Path displayed enough raw physical power to rip Jiraiya's arm off and crush his throat with basic taijutsu, as well as to throw the Animal Path all the way into Konohagakure from the outskirts of the village. Additionally, the Asura Path was able to survive otherwise fatal damage due to its mechanised insides. All of these abilities befitted the \"warring demon\" name that the Asura Path held, whilst giving it a considerable degree of versatility.\n\n\nMechanisms[]\nThe detached hand being launched.As displayed through Nagato's Path, not only was the arm detachable, but a cluster of segmented missiles produced from within it.The arm itself could be used as a launching pad to launch the missiles.The Path's head opening up to reveal a cannon.The Path being propelled with mechanisms from the feet. The right hand also shows additional weapons being produced.Additional arms being equipped in battle.\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Asura realm is the plane of semi-divine warring demons which people are reincarnated in due to actions based on jealousy, struggle, combat or rationalisation in a previous life, and though powerful, live in constant violence and conflict to which there is no resolution nor peace. Following a common depiction of Asura, this ability allows the user to possess six arms and three faces, each of which display a different emotion. Like Deva, Asura are also a race of supernatural beings. They are also featured in Hinduism as divine beings, and are known to live a life pursuing power, while indulgent and representative of materialistic and carnal pleasures. Both depictions play in the abilities of the Asura Path.\nIt also draws inspiration from Hinduism, where Asuras in mythology purportedly had the ability (called Astra) to use magical equivalents to modern day biological missiles.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 257\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 6"},

He was also able to turn his skin to rock, either entirely or partly, and could even survive being blown to bits by simply assembling himself.\nIn the anime, during the Fourth Shinobi World War, the White Zetsu Army were seen using this ability as well; allowing them to take on the property of the red soil around them.

Tsunade believed that no ordinary shinobi would be able to copy the method of this mixture, and that the skills of an artisan would be required.\n\nIngredients[]\n\n\n\nChinese licorice (\u7518\u8349, Kanz\u014d)\nCinnamomi cortex (\u6842\u76ae, Keihi)\nDeer antlers (\u9e7f\u306e\u89d2, Shika no tsuno)\nRehmanniae radix (\u5730\u9ec3, Ji\u014d)\nCaryophylli flos (\u4e01\u5b50, Ch\u014dji)\nGinseng radix (\u4eba\u53c2, Ninjin)\nSea dragon (\u6d77\u99ac, Kaiba)\nCurcumae rhizema (\u9b31\u91d1, Ukon)\n\n\nPaeoniae radix (\u828d\u85e5, Shakuyaku)\nCistanchis herba (\u8089\u84ef\u84c9, Nikujuy\u014d)\nAgkistrodon japonicae (\u53cd\u9f3b, Hanpi)\nLinderae umbellatae Ramus (\u70cf\u6a1f, Ush\u014d)\nEpimedii herba (\u6deb\u7f8a\u85ff, In'y\u014dkaku)\nSaposhnikoviae radix (\u9632\u98a8, B\u014df\u016b)\nViper (\u876e, Mamushi)\nDried lizard (\u5e72\u8725\u8734, Hitokage)\n\nAppearance[]\nThe cursed seal is reminiscent of a green skull, with an open jaw. The inside, however, consists of various ducts and slots, leading to a bottom slot at the \"jaw\". By activating several hand seals, the ingredient names will appear in the corresponding slot sections of the seal. The seal is applied onto Mizuki's right forearm.\nWhile the potion ingredients are grounded into liquid and poured into their respective slots, they each have a different colour. However, when all of them are mixed together into the potion itself, the colour becomes a glowing crimson, similar to when the cursed seals activate and spread across a person's body.\n\nPowers[]\nWhen the ingredients are formed into the potion and then ingested, the user will go into the first stage of the cursed seal and obtain enhanced abilities along with muscle growth and, in Mizuki's case with his tiger-like stripes, traits of an animal. With his strengthened muscles, he was able to smash his opponents through solid ground and throw them to great distances. He also gained tremendous increase in speed, allowing him to overrun both Naruto Uzumaki and Iruka Umino with ease, appearing as a barely visible blur whenever he moved. Iruka also noted that Mizuki's chakra levels rose drastically.\nWhen the second level is reached, the user will gain specific characteristics of the animal, along with immense increases in their strength and abilities. Since Mizuki added the extracts of a tiger to the mix, he transformed into a bipedal tiger, with increase in strength, but a great drop in speed and sharpness in his attacks.\nUnique as this cursed seal is, even the markings gained differs from the typical ones: this seal's first stage does not spread in a pattern across the user's body, but instead gives Mizuki stripes on his arms and face alone; the second stage does not give him a beige-skin mutation, but instead a bipedal-animal form.\n\nDrawbacks[]\n     Mizuki's cells destroyed by the incomplete potion, and being stabilised by Kit\u014d.  \nAs the potion was an incomplete experiment, the effects are only temporary. Because the sudden burst of power places a huge burden on the cells, far beyond a body's limit, and the results will backfire, destroying the user's body.\nFor Mizuki's case, the potion was incomplete when he drank it, so when the effects dissipated, he shrivelled up into a malnourished and powerless old man, and would have died if not for Tsunade's medical skills. Regardless, Mizuki lost all of his powers and could never be a ninja again.\n\nTrivia[]\nThe hidden room where the ingredients can be processed is locked behind a boulder which will recede if a kunai is inserted into a slot in front. The stone table required to mix the ingredients is hidden under the stone floor, which requires a hidden chain switch, underneath the eighth wall tile on the right side from the entrance, to be pulled, to trigger the hydraulics to open the trapdoor and elevate the table.\nIn Naruto Mobile, when entering the second level of the seal, Mizuki releases a stream of red chakra throughout his body, similar to the Jinch\u016briki's chakra cloak, increasing his speed and attacks."},

Sasuke can also use this technique to escape from restraints and bind an opponent in his place,[5] or to discard any foreign weapons embedded in his body.[6] Despite this technique stemming from his Rinnegan, Sasuke does not actually need to be looking at an object in order to swap places with it.[7]\nSasuke can also target other objects and individuals with this technique in order to shift them to another space in his surroundings.[8] This allows him to transport a weapon into his hand, or to project one of his techniques, such as the Chidori, to a remote location.[5] By launching an attack and then bringing his opponent to him at the last possible moment, Sasuke can ensure that his techniques hit their mark.[9] However, the opponent must be within a certain range of him for this to take effect, and with sufficient speed, it is possible to escape this technique's range before it can be activated.[10] While storing the chakra of the nine tailed beasts within his Susanoo, Sasuke demonstrated the ability to shift both himself and his Susanoo behind Naruto Uzumaki, who was a considerable distance away.[11]\nUpon first obtaining his Rinnegan, Sasuke had to wait for his eye to recharge after using this technique several times in quick succession,[12] and further overuse would cause his eye to bleed.[13] In adulthood, Sasuke is able to use this technique even while his Rinnegan's ocular power is diminished due to using its other abilities.[14][15]\n\nInfluence[]\nThis technique's name comes from Ame-no-tajikarao, the Japanese deity who used his brute strength to pull Amaterasu out of the cave where she was hiding from her brother, thus returning sunlight to the world. The technique's workings may be derived from the Iwato dance of the Sada Shrine; after Ame-no-tajikarao opens the cave and Amaterasu emerges, he takes her place inside the cave.\n\nTrivia[]\nAccording to Sasuke, this technique is a result of being blessed with the Sage of Six Paths' power.[16]\nDespite being a space\u2013time ninjutsu rather than accelerated movement, Naruto Uzumaki once described this technique as being similar to the Body Flicker Technique.[16]\nSee Also[]\nBody Replacement Technique\nFlying Thunder God Mutually Instantaneous Revolving Technique\nFlying Thunder God Technique\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 Fourth Databook, page 230\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 685, pages 16-17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 674, page 2\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 674, pages 7-8\n\n\u2191 5.0 5.1 Boruto episode 65\n\n\u2191 Boruto chapter 38, pages 9-10\n\n\u2191 Boruto: Naruto the Movie\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 682, page 9\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 674, pages 11-13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 674, page 14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 696, pages 8-10\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 687, page 4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 686, page 14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 700+6, page 3\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 700+8, page 17\n\n\u2191 16.0 16.1 Naruto chapter 681, page 3"},

Because Amenominaka works on everybody in the vicinity of Kaguya, she cannot use it to escape from attackers or to transport only certain individuals to other dimensions; for both purposes, she instead relies on Yomotsu Hirasaka.[5] Kaguya does seem to have some control over where she and the others will appear within a dimension, giving her a strategic option: when first depicted, she shifts high into the air of her lava dimension, leaving her opponents to fall into the molten sea below;[2] when she is being attacked by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, she shifts to a part of her ice dimension that places Naruto and Sasuke within a glacier, trapping them and thus stopping their attack.[5]\nWhen Kakashi Hatake first experiences Amenominaka, he believes it is the result of a genjutsu because of how suddenly it happens and how stark the change is from where he was (Earth).

However, with enough speed, it is possible to avoid, dodge,[4] or intercept the jutsu before it has been cast.[5][6] Said to be \"the fires from hell\" and to burn as hot as the sun itself,[1] Amaterasu burns any material \u2014 other flames included \u2014 until nothing but ash remains.[7] Throughout the series some objects have shown a degree of imperviousness to the flames, such as Gaara's chakra-infused sand[8] and Naruto's Version 1 chakra cloak.[9] Befitting their description as never disappearing and immortal,[10] Amaterasu's flames cannot be extinguished through most conventional means and will continue burning until their target is completely incinerated;[11] only the user can put out the flames.[12]\nAmaterasu does not ordinarily require hand seals to be performed, though Sasuke Uchiha once used the Tiger hand seal, which is common for fire techniques.[13] This technique can also be sealed within the Sharingan of another person.[14] Beyond mere offence, Amaterasu's flames can be used as a deterrent, with users surrounding themselves in its flames to discourage physical attacks.[15]\nUse of this technique puts a great deal of strain on the user, usually causing their eyes to bleed. Though the user can make Amaterasu incinerate things near-instantly when focusing on it, Amaterasu burns fairly slowly normally, allowing targets to remove burning clothes before their body is caught ablaze or, if it is too late for that, remove the burning body part(s) before it spreads.[16] Other defensive options are pushing the flames away,[17] absorbing them through the Rinnegan,[18] K\u0101ma absorption,[19] certain space\u2013time ninjutsu,[20] or being the jinch\u016briki of the Ten-Tails.[21] While impractical as a defence, Amaterasu can also be sealed.\nBecause of the ability of his right Mangeky\u014d Sharingan, Sasuke can control and shape the flames of Amaterasu using Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi.\n\nInfluence[]\nAmaterasu, like Tsukuyomi and Susanoo, is a god in ancient Japanese myth and the Shint\u014d religion. Amaterasu, the Sun Goddess, was born from the left eye of Izanagi when he performed the cleansing ritual after escaping the underworld.\n\nTrivia[]\nDespite being initially described as spawning at the user's point of focus, Amaterasu has at times been depicted as traveling through space towards its targets, making it possible for other high speed techniques to counter it.[22]\nSee Also[]\nHinokagutsuchi\nTrue Fire of Samadhi\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 Second Databook, page 200\n\n\u2191 Third Databook, page 289\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 390, page 3\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 218\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 463, page 12\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 464, page 12\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 390, page 1\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 464, page 12\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 697, pages 6-7\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 236\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 391, page 5\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 415, pages 7-8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 682, page 4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 397, pages 1-4\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 463, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 635, page 13\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 550, page 14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 657, pages 2-3\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 204\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 397, pages 2-8\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 642, page 1-3\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 390"},

When he first demonstrated it, they suddenly disobeyed him and attempted to attack the audience, which led Kurotsuchi to reject the technique's further development. Despite this, \u014cnoki continued to hone this technique in secrecy, eventually managing to create more obedient creatures.\nIwagakure housed an underground facility where more Akuta are being mass produced. It was later destroyed by Konohamaru Sarutobi.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 88\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 82\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 89"},
{"jutsu_name": "Air Sand Protective Wall", "jutsu_type": "Ninjutsu", "jutsu_description": "This air defence technique creates a giant shield of sand that is suspended in mid-air by raising a great amount of sand from the ground. By gathering the best possible mineral-rich sand, the hardness of the shield is considered to be very high. \nFurthermore, the sand has its defensive strength raised by flowing chakra through it. It was strong enough to protect Sunagakure from Deidara's C3, and stop a lightened Tengai Shinsei.\nIn the The Last: Naruto the Movie, Gaara uses this technique in conjunction with wind-natured chakra, creating multiple giant sand shields, to protect his village from a falling meteor.\n\nTrivia[]\nK\u016bsa, when written as \u7a7a\u4f50, is a rank in the Japan Air Self-Defence Force.

Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.[2] The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.[1] In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.[3] Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.[4]\n\nThe chains creating a barrier.The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.1/2\nA barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.[5] Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' jinch\u016briki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent. Orochimaru labels this the same ability as Kushina possessed,[7] but Jin no Sho describes it only as a \"glimpse\" of Kushina's Adamantine Sealing Chains.[1]\n\nSee Also[]\nBeast Sealing Technique\nDemonic Statue Chains\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 Jin no Sho, page 253\n\n\u2191 2.0 2.1 Naruto chapter 498\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 408\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 503\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 504\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 501\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 663"},

More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body. The first two are held in the hinge joint of his right and left arm, another between his shoulder blade and neck, one in his mouth, under his left armpit, another between the hip joint of his right, raised leg and the back leg of the same raised leg. As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.[3] The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha,[4] and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu H\u014dzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.[5] Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.[6]\nThe swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.[7] Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.[8] In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.[9]\n\nTrivia[]\nAs with many techniques of Kumogakure ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation.\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 229\n\n\u2191 Naruto Collectible Card Game\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 542, page 6\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 411, page 14\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 411, page 15\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 411, page 18\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 411, page 17\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 550, page 3\n\n\u2191 Naruto: Shipp\u016bden episode 298"},

He was a haiku poet, well-known for his free style haiku lacking the traditional 5-7-5 syllabic rule and seasonal word. He is called a wandering poet for the many trips he took in his later life as a Buddhist monk, wandering through Japan without being part of a monastery.\nThe san in Sant\u014dka's name is actually written with the kanji for mountain (\u5c71), but for this technique, it is interpreted as acid (\u9178), also pronounced san.

 Fighting Dreamers don't care what people think about them
 Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe

 Now open your eyes and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
 There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!

 My body movements have finally returned…
 Blood…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Say! Say! What’s happening?!
 Why’s Kabuto fighting with Old Lady Tsunade?!
 Take a good look at the headband!
 He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.
 Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!
 That man is Orochimaru…
 Shizune, you take care of the guy with the glasses…
 I’ll take care of Orochimaru.
 Before that, I’d like to have Tsunade do something about this body.
 The effects of that drug might still last for awhile…
 There’s nothing that I can do about it.
 What? Really?
 Geez. I guess it can’t be helped.
 I have no choice but to fight in this condition.
 Tsunade… Rest your body with Recovery Ninjutsu.
 Then… What about me, me?
 You guard Tsunade together with that pig.
 What?! I want to fight, too. Even I can--
 No, you won’t!
 Like that four-eyed kid said, right?
 You’re on a different level.
 The opponent is a Sannin like myself,
 and the man who killed the Third Hokage.
 An eye for an eye… I’m the only one who can fight him.
 And that four-eyed guy possesses the same level of power as Kakashi.
 Okay.
 Then… Shadow Clo--
 Hold it!
 Don’t use the Shadow Clone Jutsu. lt’d be utterly pointless.
 What?
 It wouldn’t even become much of a diversion…
 It’d be a waste of Chakra…
 with them as opponents.
 Now then, let’s get this thing started.
 – Summoning Jutsu. – Summoning Jutsu.
 Hi.
 – Huh?! 					– What is this?!
 – Wha--?! – What the heck’s going on?!
 Long time no see.
 On account of the drug,
 Master Jiraiya still can’t build up Chakra very well.
 It looks like your stupid still hasn’t healed, eh, Jiraiya.
 That’s too much even for you with no ability.
 It seems Tsunade got you with something.
 A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,
 so perhaps she was thinking ahead and drugged him
 with something that would contain his power.
 To think she’d make a sacrifice of Jiraiya…
 Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.
 To think I’d already have my handicap spotted.
 You are such a disgraceful guy as always…
 Dang it. It kind of ticks me off when the Pervy Sage is mocked.
 Summoning…Jutsu!
 The Nine-Tailed Fox kid from the Chunin Exam.
 I wonder if I should’ve killed him then, after all.
 For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,
 I acknowledged his achievement… and let him slide by.
 But the only ones who can break a Five-Pronged Spell
 are the Sannin members and the Third Hokage.
 Which means Jiraiya may have already taught it to Naruto.
 Perhaps.
 If he’s able to control the Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…
 Oh…
 Th-This is…
 It doesn’t quite look to be so.
 He isn’t endowed with Shinobi ability to begin with, so…
 Why?
 He’s still got a long way to go, sure enough.
 Why?!
 Hello.
 Hey, Gamatatsu. Why did you come out?
 Oh, Brother Gamakichi.
 It’s the first time I’ve been Summoned.
 I-I wonder if I can do my best?
 Idiot. Get some snacks or something and hide.
 What? I can get snacks? Goody-goody.
 Here I go.
 I’ll take Jiraiya.
 I leave the rest to you.
 It’s unfortunate…
 Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya, one of the Sannin.
 Naruto!
 Your opponent is me.
 Earth Style! Dark Swamp!
 Dang it. I can’t completely sink them with such a puny swamp.
 The drug is still working.
 But…with this, the snakes can’t move.
 Ninja Art! Poison Fog!
 I’ll be up a creek if I take even one breath.
 My leg tendons…!
 I won’t be eaten twice…! No way!
 Here I go.
 Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!
 Dang it…The Jutsu isn’t working well.
 Even if we both have handicaps, you won’t one-up me…
 Give up now.
 It’s unfortunate…
 Here I had respected you as a fellow Medical Ninja.
 Stop. Stay back!
 Please hang on, Lady Tsunade…
 The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru is also called, will cry.
 My body’s heavy.
 To think you who were once called the village madness
 would ferry around such a kid and struggle tirelessly for the village.
 You’ve really fallen, haven’t you?
 I have a keen eye to discern ability.
 And that kid…is mediocrity in my eyes.
 It’s precisely for this reason… that I don’t need the Uchiha kid.
 It’s no fun raising a genius who’s good from the start.
 So you can’t leave him alone
 because it’s like you’re looking at your old self?
 That kid can’t beat Uchiha who inherited the inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.
 And that’s because Naruto doesn’t possess the Sharingan.
 Shinobi ability is about whether
 one can use and master all the Jutsu of the world.
 Ninja refers to one who can use Ninjutsu.
 Shinobi ability is no such thing.
 You still don’t get it?
 A Ninja…is one who endures.
 It’s a difference of opinion, huh.
 I’ll teach you one thing.
 What’s most important for Shinobi ability…
 isn’t the number of Jutsu one possesses.
 What’s important is…
 The mettle…
 not to give up.
 Enough already…you jerk!
 The mettle to never give up…
 He possesses that.
 Heh. I don’t know what Jutsu you learned,
 but you can’t hit me with such a large motion.
 No good.
 It won’t easily hit with a moving opponent.
 Owwee!
 And the Chakra isn’t completely held, yet…
 It seems you got a cracked thigh bone in your left leg
 from the battle with the snake.
 Well, you can still move if it’s just the bone.
 But it’s impossible now…
 The lateral vastus muscle in your right leg is totally cut off.
 What should I do…?
 That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.
 If even one arm is taken out, it’s over.
 Are you scared of me?
 Do you want to run away from here?
 Naruto, as I recall,
 you whooped it up like this during the first Chunin Exam.
 Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away!
 ""Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away.""
 ""I’ll take it. Even if I’m a Genin for life…""
 ""I’ll become the Hokage at any cost, so it’s okay with me.""
 ""I’m not scared.""
 Can you… whoop it up in the same way now?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the Hokage name no matter what!
 – Hokage is my dream! – Hokage is my dream!
 You’re not a kid anymore, so you should stop whooping it up…
 Depending on the situation,
 when you want to give up and run away, you should run away.
 Oh my… What’s with that look?
 You’ll die! If you die, there are no dreams or anything…
 Do you want to die?
 You’re still a Genin, so you should run away on the battlefield.
 Don’t tell a man to run away.
 Kids think that everything is easy.
 That’s why they talk about foolish dreams like nothing at all.
 That’s why they can’t give up.
 Jiraiya, was it you who taught him that Rasengan?
 Are you acting like a teacher by teaching a Jutsu that can’t be learned?
 Don’t give him false hopes.
 That’s why a moony kid starts joking that he’ll become the Hokage!
 They chase after foolish dreams… and then die.
 If I have three days, I’ll master that Jutsu.
 Then let's make a bet.
 Bastard!
 As for me… I stand by my words.
 That’s…my Way of Ninja!
 A bet?
 I’ll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 I’ll acknowledge that you’ll be able to become the Hokage…
 and give you this necklace.
 You should’ve just stayed out of this…
 Why?
 Why?!
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 You’re still going to get up?
 Just like our wager
 I will definitely win that unlucky necklace from you.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone won’t do anything now.
 Enough… Don’t protect me, Naruto. Stop it!
 I told you that you’d die if you were obstinate like that, right?
 If you die, there will be no dreams, no nothing.
 Just get out of the way. Run away.
 Humph… It’s okay.
 I…
 I absolutely will not die…
 until I become the Hokage!
 This way, I can hold on to you. Here I go!
 It’s the same Chakra movement as before.
 No, this is…different.
 I see.
 In order to gain a hand for suppressing Chakra,
 the Shadow Clone…
 Compress Chakra and…
 hold it completely.
 Wha--?!
 I-It can’t be.
 Rasengan!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 I never forget my ideal…
 to develop the Village Hidden in the Leaf and protect its people.
 The Hokages have sacrificed their lives for that dream.
 And now, I also will put my life on the line.
 From this moment, I am the Fifth Hokage!
 Next time: ""The Fifth Hokage! A Life on the Line!""

 The Third Hokage, Forever…
 Sarutobi…
 At the very least this sword…
 It was a fitting end for somebody like you
 who has mastered the Way of the Shinobi.
 It feels like my arms are burning…
 Master Orochimaru!
 This is where we call off our plan.
 Release the Barrier. We’ll head back.
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 – Release! 					– Release!
 The Barrier…!
 It’s released!
 Where is Lord Hokage?
 Let’s go!
 We won’t let you get away!
 Ninja Art: Spider Web Net!
 An adhesive type of string filled with Chakra…?
 Kakashi! They’re on the move! Do we go after them?
 No, wait, Guy.
 That’s right…
 If you make a move without any data on the situation up there,
 you will get caught in the enemy’s trap.
 I’m totally aware of that.
 But regardless of whether there is a trap or not,
 we can’t let the enemy get away at a time like this!
 That is the way of the Leaf Shinobi!
 So…are you just going to watch?
 Kabuto?
 So you did know, after all.
 So…what are we going to do?
 It’s about time that we made a retreat.
 You’re going to run away from me again?
 Right now…
 if we show our cards, they’re most likely going to be copied.
 Then again,
 it doesn't seem like you’ve completely mastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.
 Well then…
 Temari…
 Kankuro!
 I’m leaving Sakura with you.
 H-Hey!
 Why is…this guy so strong?
 My existence will not disappear…
 I will not disappear! I cannot disappear!
 I told you not to talk to that guy!
 Let’s go.
 Oh, there! That’s him…
 Go away!
 Monster! Monster! Monster…!
 You monster! Die!
 That’s him… Don’t get involved, fool!
 Don’t look at him!
 Go away!
 To them, I’m just a relic of the past who they want to see disappear.
 So what did I have in this life, why did I keep living?
 And that time, I thought of myself that I… no, that is what I had to think.
 And then knew that it was the most painful thing.
 That I… that my existence didn’t matter to anyone else in the world.
 D-Don’t come any closer!
 The pain of…being all alone… really is unbearable, isn’t it?
 The way you feel…
 I don’t know why, but I completely understand that it hurts.
 But I’ve met people who are very important to me now.
 I won’t allow those important people… to get hurt!
 If not, I will stop you even if that means…that I have to kill you!
 Why…?
 How is it that you can fight so much for other people?
 They saved me from the hell of being all alone.
 They accepted me for who I was.
 That’s why…they are important to me!
 Love is a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person…
 Love…
 That is why he is so strong?
 That’s enough, Naruto…
 Sakura is okay.
 This guy’s Chakra must have been depleted as well…
 Sakura’s sand crumbled a long time ago.
 Oh, I see…
 I’ve had enough… Stop here.
 Gaara?
 I’ve never seen Gaara in such a weakened state before…
 All right.
 Naruto Uzumaki, huh?
 LOVE 							One of these days, even I…
 Temari… Kankuro…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Sorry…
 D-Don’t worry about it…
 Rain…
 The sky has started to weep as well…
 We will begin the memorial service
 for the Third Hokage, who lost his life in this battle,
 as well as the other victims of this battle.
 It’s started…
 In the end, all we could do was just watch…
 Why?
 Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?
 Why…?
 It’s already been a year…
 It’s not easy to laugh hiding your sadness.
 I heard from your teacher that you’re the center of laughter…
 I’m not sad at all!
 It’s a very honorable thing for a Shinobi to die doing their duty!
 My dad and mom sacrificed their lives
 to protect this village from the Demon Fox…
 They’re heroes!
 I am the child of the heroes! I’m not sad to be alone.
 And besides, these are tears of joy.
 It’s all right.
 I know that you’re curled up holding your knees by yourself.
 But you’re not alone…
 Huh?
 The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village have the will of fire…
 Will of fire…?
 It’s the strong will to protect the Leaf Village.
 As long as they have this will of fire, everybody in this village are all family.
 Iruka… I wonder if you have it?
 Yeah…
 For Hayate…?
 The Third Hokage’s funeral has already started. Make it quick.
 You too, Kakashi, is it for Obito…?
 If you’re always thinking of an excuse for your tardiness,
 you should just come earlier.
 I do…from early in the morning.
 It’s just that, whenever I come here
 I just want to punish myself for being such a fool in the past.
 Humph…
 Shinobi, no matter what kind of situation they are in,
 cannot show their emotion.
 You must always prioritize your mission,
 and never shed a tear in any kind of situation…
 Iruka Sensei…
 Hmm?
 Why do people risk their own lives for other people?
 When one person dies…
 their past, their present life, and their future disappear along with them.
 Many people die doing their duty and fighting in battle…
 And shockingly easily, too.
 Hayate was one of them.
 Those who pass away also have dreams and ambitions.
 But everyone has something else, just as important.
 Parents, siblings, friends, lovers… Those who are dear to them.
 They trust each other and help each other,
 the people whom they’ve cherished since the day they were born.
 And that string which connects those people
 becomes stronger and thicker as time goes by…
 It can’t be explained by logic…
 Those who hold those strings just do it, because it’s important to them.
 Yeah, I kind of get it.
 But…
 It's tough to die.
 It’s not like he just died for nothing.
 He left us something very important.
 Well, you’ll eventually understand one of these days.
 Yeah, I kind of get that too!
 The rain’s stopped.
 Bye! Iruka Sensei!
 Yeah…
 Lord Third Hokage, the will of fire you spoke of
 seems to have been passed on to the young Leaves.
 The flame in their hearts which you lit
 will burn bright and strong…
 And it will shine upon this village, and watch over and protect us.
 It will become a new Hokage… one of these days…
 They did manage to avoid annihilation,
 but it seems the damage is pretty extensive.
 The village that was once at the height of its glory…
 How sad…
 How unlike you.
 You have lingering affections for your old home?
 Even you?
 No, not at all.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 The ritual ends, and morning mist will be covering all soon.
 Silence…
 In that white mist, the shadow quietly sharpens its fangs.
 It awakens childhood memory, disappointment, ire, and resolve.
 The cog wheel named destiny slowly begins to turn…
 Next time: “Return of the Morning Mist”

94,"We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
 Fighting Dreamers don't care what people think about them
 Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe
 Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
 Right here right now (Bang) Hit it straight like a line drive!
 Right here right now (Burn)
 Down a difficult road filled with endless struggles
 Where do you think you are going following someone else's map?
 An insightful crow comes along to tear up the map
 Now open your eyes and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
 There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!
 We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
 Fighting Dreamers don't care what people think about them
 Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe
 Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
 Right here right now (Bang) Hit it straight like a line drive!
 Right here right now (Burn) We're gonna do it and do our best!
 Right here right now (Bang) Hit it straight like a line drive!
 Right here right now (Burn) We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
 My body movements have finally returned…
 Blood…
 Lady Tsunade!
 Say! Say! What’s happening?!
 Why’s Kabuto fighting with Old Lady Tsunade?!
 Take a good look at the headband!
 He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.
 Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!
 That man is Orochimaru…
 Shizune, you take care of the guy with the glasses…
 I’ll take care of Orochimaru.
 Before that, I’d like to have Tsunade do something about this body.
 The effects of that drug might still last for awhile…
 There’s nothing that I can do about it.
 What? Really?
 Geez. I guess it can’t be helped.
 I have no choice but to fight in this condition.
 Tsunade… Rest your body with Recovery Ninjutsu.
 Then… What about me, me?
 You guard Tsunade together with that pig.
 What?! I want to fight, too. Even I can--
 No, you won’t!
 Like that four-eyed kid said, right?
 You’re on a different level.
 The opponent is a Sannin like myself,
 and the man who killed the Third Hokage.
 An eye for an eye… I’m the only one who can fight him.
 And that four-eyed guy possesses the same level of power as Kakashi.
 Okay.
 Then… Shadow Clo--
 Hold it!
 Don’t use the Shadow Clone Jutsu. lt’d be utterly pointless.
 What?
 It wouldn’t even become much of a diversion…
 It’d be a waste of Chakra…
 with them as opponents.
 Now then, let’s get this thing started.
 – Summoning Jutsu. – Summoning Jutsu.
 Hi.
 – Huh?! 					– What is this?!
 – Wha--?! – What the heck’s going on?!
 Long time no see.
 On account of the drug,
 Master Jiraiya still can’t build up Chakra very well.
 It looks like your stupid still hasn’t healed, eh, Jiraiya.
 That’s too much even for you with no ability.
 It seems Tsunade got you with something.
 A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,
 so perhaps she was thinking ahead and drugged him
 with something that would contain his power.
 To think she’d make a sacrifice of Jiraiya…
 Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.
 To think I’d already have my handicap spotted.
 You are such a disgraceful guy as always…
 Dang it. It kind of ticks me off when the Pervy Sage is mocked.
 Summoning…Jutsu!
 The Nine-Tailed Fox kid from the Chunin Exam.
 I wonder if I should’ve killed him then, after all.
 For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,
 I acknowledged his achievement… and let him slide by.
 But the only ones who can break a Five-Pronged Spell
 are the Sannin members and the Third Hokage.
 Which means Jiraiya may have already taught it to Naruto.
 Perhaps.
 If he’s able to control the Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…
 Oh…
 Th-This is…
 It doesn’t quite look to be so.
 He isn’t endowed with Shinobi ability to begin with, so…
 Why?
 He’s still got a long way to go, sure enough.
 Why?!
 Hello.
 Hey, Gamatatsu. Why did you come out?
 Oh, Brother Gamakichi.
 It’s the first time I’ve been Summoned.
 I-I wonder if I can do my best?
 Idiot. Get some snacks or something and hide.
 What? I can get snacks? Goody-goody.
 Here I go.
 I’ll take Jiraiya.
 I leave the rest to you.
 It’s unfortunate…
 Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya, one of the Sannin.
 Naruto!
 Your opponent is me.
 Earth Style! Dark Swamp!
 Dang it. I can’t completely sink them with such a puny swamp.
 The drug is still working.
 But…with this, the snakes can’t move.
 Ninja Art! Poison Fog!
 I’ll be up a creek if I take even one breath.
 My leg tendons…!
 I won’t be eaten twice…! No way!
 Here I go.
 Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!
 Dang it…The Jutsu isn’t working well.
 Even if we both have handicaps, you won’t one-up me…
 Give up now.
 It’s unfortunate…
 Here I had respected you as a fellow Medical Ninja.
 Stop. Stay back!
 Please hang on, Lady Tsunade…
 The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru is also called, will cry.
 My body’s heavy.
 To think you who were once called the village madness
 would ferry around such a kid and struggle tirelessly for the village.
 You’ve really fallen, haven’t you?
 I have a keen eye to discern ability.
 And that kid…is mediocrity in my eyes.
 It’s precisely for this reason… that I don’t need the Uchiha kid.
 It’s no fun raising a genius who’s good from the start.
 So you can’t leave him alone
 because it’s like you’re looking at your old self?
 That kid can’t beat Uchiha who inherited the inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.
 And that’s because Naruto doesn’t possess the Sharingan.
 Shinobi ability is about whether
 one can use and master all the Jutsu of the world.
 Ninja refers to one who can use Ninjutsu.
 Shinobi ability is no such thing.
 You still don’t get it?
 A Ninja…is one who endures.
 It’s a difference of opinion, huh.
 I’ll teach you one thing.
 What’s most important for Shinobi ability…
 isn’t the number of Jutsu one possesses.
 What’s important is…
 The mettle…
 not to give up.
 Enough already…you jerk!
 The mettle to never give up…
 He possesses that.
 Heh. I don’t know what Jutsu you learned,
 but you can’t hit me with such a large motion.
 No good.
 It won’t easily hit with a moving opponent.
 Owwee!
 And the Chakra isn’t completely held, yet…
 It seems you got a cracked thigh bone in your left leg
 from the battle with the snake.
 Well, you can still move if it’s just the bone.
 But it’s impossible now…
 The lateral vastus muscle in your right leg is totally cut off.
 What should I do…?
 That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.
 If even one arm is taken out, it’s over.
 Are you scared of me?
 Do you want to run away from here?
 Naruto, as I recall,
 you whooped it up like this during the first Chunin Exam.
 Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away!
 ""Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away.""
 ""I’ll take it. Even if I’m a Genin for life…""
 ""I’ll become the Hokage at any cost, so it’s okay with me.""
 ""I’m not scared.""
 Can you… whoop it up in the same way now?
 Unlike you…
 I will be the heir to the Hokage name no matter what!
 – Hokage is my dream! – Hokage is my dream!
 You’re not a kid anymore, so you should stop whooping it up…
 Depending on the situation,
 when you want to give up and run away, you should run away.
 Oh my… What’s with that look?
 You’ll die! If you die, there are no dreams or anything…
 Do you want to die?
 You’re still a Genin, so you should run away on the battlefield.
 Don’t tell a man to run away.
 Kids think that everything is easy.
 That’s why they talk about foolish dreams like nothing at all.
 That’s why they can’t give up.
 Jiraiya, was it you who taught him that Rasengan?
 Are you acting like a teacher by teaching a Jutsu that can’t be learned?
 Don’t give him false hopes.
 That’s why a moony kid starts joking that he’ll become the Hokage!
 They chase after foolish dreams… and then die.
 If I have three days, I’ll master that Jutsu.
 Then let's make a bet.
 Bastard!
 As for me… I stand by my words.
 That’s…my Way of Ninja!
 A bet?
 I’ll give you one week.
 If you can master that Jutsu,
 I’ll acknowledge that you’ll be able to become the Hokage…
 and give you this necklace.
 You should’ve just stayed out of this…
 Why?
 Why?!
 Old Lady Tsunade…
 You’re still going to get up?
 Just like our wager
 I will definitely win that unlucky necklace from you.
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Shadow Clone won’t do anything now.
 Enough… Don’t protect me, Naruto. Stop it!
 I told you that you’d die if you were obstinate like that, right?
 If you die, there will be no dreams, no nothing.
 Just get out of the way. Run away.
 Humph… It’s okay.
 I…
 I absolutely will not die…
 until I become the Hokage!
 This way, I can hold on to you. Here I go!
 It’s the same Chakra movement as before.
 No, this is…different.
 I see.
 In order to gain a hand for suppressing Chakra,
 the Shadow Clone…
 Compress Chakra and…
 hold it completely.
 Wha--?!
 I-It can’t be.
 Rasengan!
 I believe your promise, its a true heart give me courage
 Always I feel it the precious time with you
 On your still shoulder
 I feel the wind that blows towards tomorrow
 The city lights are like pieces of stars
 That hold us together
 “Each one of us glows differently,”
 you say laughingly
 but you look most dazzling
 Like a comet,
 like the rainbow after the storm
 You bring light into my heart
 Being lost can be the answer
 Let’s promise we won’t cheat
 Uh... like a shooting star, we do go ahead.
 I never forget my ideal…
 to develop the Village Hidden in the Leaf and protect its people.
 The Hokages have sacrificed their lives for that dream.
 And now, I also will put my life on the line.
 From this moment, I am the Fifth Hokage!
 Next time: ""The Fifth Hokage! A Life on the Line!""

 The Third Hokage, Forever…
 Sarutobi…
 At the very least this sword…
 It was a fitting end for somebody like you
 who has mastered the Way of the Shinobi.
 It feels like my arms are burning…
 Master Orochimaru!
 This is where we call off our plan.
 Release the Barrier. We’ll head back.
 – Yes! 					– Yes!
 – Release! 					– Release!
 The Barrier…!
 It’s released!
 Where is Lord Hokage?
 Let’s go!
 We won’t let you get away!
 Ninja Art: Spider Web Net!
 An adhesive type of string filled with Chakra…?
 Kakashi! They’re on the move! Do we go after them?
 No, wait, Guy.
 That’s right…
 If you make a move without any data on the situation up there,
 you will get caught in the enemy’s trap.
 I’m totally aware of that.
 But regardless of whether there is a trap or not,
 we can’t let the enemy get away at a time like this!
 That is the way of the Leaf Shinobi!
 So…are you just going to watch?
 Kabuto?
 So you did know, after all.
 So…what are we going to do?
 It’s about time that we made a retreat.
 You’re going to run away from me again?
 Right now…
 if we show our cards, they’re most likely going to be copied.
 Then again,
 it doesn't seem like you’ve completely mastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.
 Well then…
 Temari…
 Kankuro!
 I’m leaving Sakura with you.
 H-Hey!
 Why is…this guy so strong?
 My existence will not disappear…
 I will not disappear! I cannot disappear!
 I told you not to talk to that guy!
 Let’s go.
 Oh, there! That’s him…
 Go away!
 Monster! Monster! Monster…!
 You monster! Die!
 That’s him… Don’t get involved, fool!
 Don’t look at him!
 Go away!
 To them, I’m just a relic of the past who they want to see disappear.
 So what did I have in this life, why did I keep living?
 And that time, I thought of myself that I… no, that is what I had to think.
 And then knew that it was the most painful thing.
 That I… that my existence didn’t matter to anyone else in the world.
 D-Don’t come any closer!
 The pain of…being all alone… really is unbearable, isn’t it?
 The way you feel…
 I don’t know why, but I completely understand that it hurts.
 But I’ve met people who are very important to me now.
 I won’t allow those important people… to get hurt!
 If not, I will stop you even if that means…that I have to kill you!
 Why…?
 How is it that you can fight so much for other people?
 They saved me from the hell of being all alone.
 They accepted me for who I was.
 That’s why…they are important to me!
 Love is a heart that desires to serve a precious person who is close to oneself,
 to love and watch over that person…
 Love…
 That is why he is so strong?
 That’s enough, Naruto…
 Sakura is okay.
 This guy’s Chakra must have been depleted as well…
 Sakura’s sand crumbled a long time ago.
 Oh, I see…
 I’ve had enough… Stop here.
 Gaara?
 I’ve never seen Gaara in such a weakened state before…
 All right.
 Naruto Uzumaki, huh?
 LOVE 							One of these days, even I…
 Temari… Kankuro…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 Sorry…
 D-Don’t worry about it…
 Rain…
 The sky has started to weep as well…
 We will begin the memorial service
 for the Third Hokage, who lost his life in this battle,
 as well as the other victims of this battle.
 It’s started…
 In the end, all we could do was just watch…
 Why?
 Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?
 Why…?
 It’s already been a year…
 It’s not easy to laugh hiding your sadness.
 I heard from your teacher that you’re the center of laughter…
 I’m not sad at all!
 It’s a very honorable thing for a Shinobi to die doing their duty!
 My dad and mom sacrificed their lives
 to protect this village from the Demon Fox…
 They’re heroes!
 I am the child of the heroes! I’m not sad to be alone.
 And besides, these are tears of joy.
 It’s all right.
 I know that you’re curled up holding your knees by yourself.
 But you’re not alone…
 Huh?
 The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village have the will of fire…
 Will of fire…?
 It’s the strong will to protect the Leaf Village.
 As long as they have this will of fire, everybody in this village are all family.
 Iruka… I wonder if you have it?
 Yeah…
 For Hayate…?
 The Third Hokage’s funeral has already started. Make it quick.
 You too, Kakashi, is it for Obito…?
 If you’re always thinking of an excuse for your tardiness,
 you should just come earlier.
 I do…from early in the morning.
 It’s just that, whenever I come here
 I just want to punish myself for being such a fool in the past.
 Humph…
 Shinobi, no matter what kind of situation they are in,
 cannot show their emotion.
 You must always prioritize your mission,
 and never shed a tear in any kind of situation…
 Iruka Sensei…
 Hmm?
 Why do people risk their own lives for other people?
 When one person dies…
 their past, their present life, and their future disappear along with them.
 Many people die doing their duty and fighting in battle…
 And shockingly easily, too.
 Hayate was one of them.
 Those who pass away also have dreams and ambitions.
 But everyone has something else, just as important.
 Parents, siblings, friends, lovers… Those who are dear to them.
 They trust each other and help each other,
 the people whom they’ve cherished since the day they were born.
 And that string which connects those people
 becomes stronger and thicker as time goes by…
 It can’t be explained by logic…
 Those who hold those strings just do it, because it’s important to them.
 Yeah, I kind of get it.
 But…
 It's tough to die.
 It’s not like he just died for nothing.
 He left us something very important.
 Well, you’ll eventually understand one of these days.
 Yeah, I kind of get that too!
 The rain’s stopped.
 Bye! Iruka Sensei!
 Yeah…
 Lord Third Hokage, the will of fire you spoke of
 seems to have been passed on to the young Leaves.
 The flame in their hearts which you lit
 will burn bright and strong…
 And it will shine upon this village, and watch over and protect us.
 It will become a new Hokage… one of these days…
 They did manage to avoid annihilation,
 but it seems the damage is pretty extensive.
 The village that was once at the height of its glory…
 How sad…
 How unlike you.
 You have lingering affections for your old home?
 Even you?
 No, not at all.
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 The ritual ends, and morning mist will be covering all soon.
 Silence…
 In that white mist, the shadow quietly sharpens its fangs.
 It awakens childhood memory, disappointment, ire, and resolve.
 The cog wheel named destiny slowly begins to turn…
 Next time: “Return of the Morning Mist”

32,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 I’ll show you there are walls
 which effort alone can never break through.
 Sakura Blossoms!
 Huh?!
 Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
 But our Jutsu exceeds that and is the speed of sound!
 Lee!
 My left ear...
 There’s a little gimmick I have.
 Evading won’t work... on my attacks.
 What is he going to do?!
 It’s sound.
 Even though you evaded my fist, sound assaulted you.
 Sound?
 Do you know what sound is all about in the first place?
 Vibration?
 Correct. In other words, hearing sounds means,
 that the eardrum is catching vibrating air.
 And the human eardrum breaks with sounds over 150 Mhz.
 Also, by assaulting the semicircular canal which is located even deeper,
 I can make you totally lose balance.
 You won’t be able to move your body freely for sometime.
 Something old and tired like Taijutsu don’t work on us.
 Well, you were doing good up to a certain point,
 but I brought forth my Jutsu.
 It’s just not gonna work anymore.
 I freely manipulate ultrasonic waves and air pressure,
 and have the power to obliterate even boulders!
 Primary Lotus!
 I can send air into the ground
 and change the dirt into a cushion as I please.
 It’s different from your silly Jutsu.
 Blast it!
 Lee, it is all right to use this Jutsu
 to protect someone precious.
 Protect... someone precious?
 In any case,
 I’m impressed that you were able to master it, little man!
 You did it quite well, Lee!
 Darn it!
 Okay, then!
 Next is...
 You!
 Darn it!
 He’s coming!
 What?!
 No way!
 Lee!
 Leaf...
 Hurricane!
 It looks like my earlier attack is having an effect!
 I’m somewhat surprised...
 but there’s not even a trace of that flash of combo Taijutsu you showed!
 This arm amplifies sounds from within to its maximum.
 It’s a speaker of sorts!
 Lee!
 And the assault sound isn’t limited by the direction of my arm...
 it always converges on the targeted prey by my Chakra!
 Lee!
 Now then... 					The final blow.
 I won’t let you!
 Oh, well.
 Hey, let’s get outta here!
 Those guys are pretty dangerous!
 It looks like Sasuke and Naruto are only unconscious, but...
 even that guy Lee’s been messed up and Sakura’s alone.
 What’re you gonna do, Ino?
 What do you mean?
 Well, Sakura’s in deep trouble!
 You’re all right with that?
 Huh?!
 You two were once close friends, weren’t you?
 By the way...
 What Sakura, don’t be so stiff!
 Well...
 Ino, I hear you also...
 What is it?
 ...like Sasuke.
 Then, that means from now on,
 you and I are rivals.
 Why... why am I recalling things from that time?
 Hey, Ino!
 What’re you gonna do?!
 I know, but there’s nothing I can do!
 I can’t heedlessly go out there, can I?!
 Even if I went out now...
 I’d be taken down without a doubt.
 I also...
 I also...!
 Air pressure! The shurikens got bounced back?!
 Your hair’s shinier than mine.
 Hey! If you have time to worry about your hair,
 you should practice!
 Getting all spiced up like a woman...
 Why don’t you kill that Sasuke guy right in front of this sexy bug, Zaku?
 Yeah! That sounds great!
 Hey hey...
 I won’t let you do such a thing!
 Don’t move!
 Sakura.
 My body... It has no strength.
 I...
 Again... I’m just pulling everyone’s feet!
 I’m always being protected.
 It's so frustrating!
 This time for sure... I had thought!
 This time for sure...
 I must protect people precious to me... so I thought!
 So...
 Let’s do this!
 Hey! Sasuke and Naruto are gonna get it, too!
 W-What should I do?!
 That’s pointless!
 That won’t work on me!
 What are you saying?
 Huh?
 What?!
 I always...
 act as if I’m a full-fledged Ninja.
 I always say that I like Sasuke.
 I always act like I know everything and lecture Naruto.
 I always just... watch them from behind.
 And yet...
 Tazuna, get back!
 Get back!
 Now then...
 Let’s get wild!
 This is the only way to take him down!
 Sasuke!
 Here it is!
 Those two always covered my back and fought for me.
 Lee, you say that you like me...
 I’ll protect you until I die!
 Primary Lotus!
 With me at your back...
 you risked your life and fought for me.
 I have a feeling that you taught me...
 Sakura!
 Sakura!
 Humph!
 I want to be like all of you!
 This time...
 I want all of you...
 to watch me...
 ...from behind!
 Sakura?
 Sakura...
 Kin! Kill her!
 Huh! That sign...
 Substitution Jutsu!
 On the right, huh? You think I’m a fool?
 With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu...
 you think you can come at me?!
 Kin, get out of the way!
 Useless!
 Air pressure 100 percent, ultrasonic waves 0%, output...
 Is that all you can do?
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 You’re easy to spot...
 You’re above!
 I’ve said it two or three times that that won’t work!
 This is enough... for you!
 Where next?
 Huh?!
 What...?!
 This time... it’s not a substitution!
 Get off me! Hey!
 Sakura...
 You’re always being called “Billboard Brow” and being picked on.
 Who’re you?
 I’m called Ino Yamanaka. How ‘bout you?
 I’m... Sakura.
 Huh? I can’t hear you. Say it louder.
 Sakura Haruno!
 Huh, I see.
 You have a wide forehead.
 So, Billboard Brow, huh...?
 That’s why you hide your forehead with your bangs.
 Like a ghost...
 Sakura, was it?
 Uh-huh...
 Come back here tomorrow.
 I’ll give you something nice.
 Huh?
 Darn, let go!
 See! You look cuter like this, Sakura!
 I’ll give you that ribbon.
 T-Thanks.
 But...
 But what?
 My forehead...
 You hide it, so people make more fun of you, you know?!
 You have a cute face Sakura, so you should be more confident!
 More confident!
 Ino...
 Hey, who’s that? Who’s she, Ino?
 Her name’s Sakura.
 Hey, say hello!
 Hello...
 Listen everybody! Listen!
 There’s someone I like! Who do you think it is?
 Hurry up and tell us!
 Don’t say it’s Sasuke?
 Huh? Why’d you know?
 What’re you talking about?
 Sasuke’s really popular, he’s the most popular!
 Huh? Is that so?
 Oh no! I’ll have a lot of rivals. What should I do?!
 Hey, Ino! Sakura’s been upbeat lately!
 She’s just acting brave and romping around!
 Ino! I’ve heard Sasuke likes girls with long hair.
 ...likes girls with long hair. ...likes girls with long hair.
 Sakura...
 I’ve heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.
 From now on, we’re rivals.
 Your hair. It’s grown quite a bit.
 Ino...
 Why...
 Why are you on the same team as Sasuke?!
 I will not lose anymore... to you, Ino!
 Me too! I won’t lose to you, Sakura. No matter what!
 ...Sakura!
 I will...
 I will...
 Give it up!
 It’s really bad...
 Hey, Ino...!
 I must... protect everyone!
 You punk!
 Huh?
 Huh! More strange ones.
 Ino...?
 Sakura! I promised I wouldn’t lose to you, didn’t I?!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Wow! This is Ino team’s battle?!
 What a formation based on calculations!
 I hate to admit it, but they’re strong!
 Even the Sound Village ones would be no match for them!
 We’ll protect Sasuke...
 Huh?! What’s this feeling?
 Next episode: ""Battle Formation: lno-Shika-Cho!""

185,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 Oh!
 Sorry, sorry.
 Was that some eagle poop just now?
 Nothing there, huh?
 Well, I worked up a sweat,
 so I guess I’ll go home and take a shower.
 A Legend from the Hidden Leaf: The Onbaa!
 I worked up a good sweat today too.
 What’s the deal, Akamaru?
 He says you smell bad, Naruto.
 Are you making sure to take a bath?
 Don’t be saying rude things!
 No, you seriously stink.
 Come to think of it…
 The poop from the eagle a moment ago might…
 Sakura.
 Oh, I found a slacker who can’t get a mission!
 That’s just… I’m not that much a slacker!
 So it seems. You must’ve done some reckless training.
 It’s ripped.
 Huh? You’re right. I didn’t notice!
 It can’t be helped.
 Bring it to me later. I’ll sew it up for you.
 Really?! Really?! Really?!
 Sakura, you’re such a nice person.
 It’s the first time in my life… you’ve been this nice to me!
 H-Hey, Naruto. You’re exaggerating.
 Naruto!
 Wh-What’re you doing, Sakura?!
 You touched my breast just now, didn’t you?!
 I didn’t do anything like that!
 Then, what’re those hairy hands sticking out from your armpit?!
 What’s…that?
 Huh? Huh?!
 Wh-What’s this?!
 Your back.
 Huh?
 Wh-What in the world is this?!
 It’s a huge poop!
 Idiot! That’s some kind of creature!
 Is it a caterpillar?!
 What?! Get it off.
 No, this is an animal.
 Let go!
 Give me a break.
 You guys, have you ever heard of the legend of Onbaa?
 Onbaa?
 I’ve never heard of it!
 Shizune! You don’t know?
 Nope. Is that legend something like an old tale or something?
 That’s what I thought, but…
 Long ago when I was young, I heard about a legend…
 A legend about a dangerous, hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa
 who lived deep in the mountains near the village…
 One day, that idiot Jiraiya eagerly went into the forest
 saying he was going to investigate the Onbaa
 for his summer vacation independent research.
 The Pervy Sage?
 Yes…
 Are you an idiot?
 Do you seriously think there’s an Onbaa?
 Well, you’ll get yours when you see my independent research!
 Who would?
 Even if there were an Onbaa, it wouldn’t deal with you…
 You said it! Flat-chested girl!
 Who’s flat-chested?!
 No way is there such a thing as an Onbaa!
 You wanna bet on that?
 Yeah! I’ll bet!
 Then, I’ll bet on Jiraiya.
 Huh?!
 Then, I’m off to wrestle with an Onbaa!
 And? Did the Pervy Sage meet an Onbaa?
 When he came back three days later,
 he said he won with a force-out move…
 which most likely was a lie.
 Oh! here it is.
 Huh? What’s this?
 What lousy writing!
 You’re one to talk, Naruto.
 Let’s see… The Onbaa is big. lt is nine-feet tall.
 The Onbaa is scary.
 No one is a match for it when it gets mad.
 But I beat it at wrestling.
 What’s this?
 The Onbaa’s child likes being carried piggyback.
 They grow up on the parent’s back.
 What?!
 What Jiraiya wrote is bogus, tracing the legend as is, but…
 So there was an Onbaa…
 Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,
 it stays piggyback on my back and won’t get off.
 What should I do?
 According to legend, the child Onbaa considers
 the first thing it sees after birth as its parent
 and clings to the back of that person.
 It seems they grow that way, piggybacked on the parent,
 until they become an adult.
 It seems until then, they never leave the parent’s back.
 Then, there’s no other way but to wait until it grows up.
 You say that, but when it grows up…
 it’ll turn into a scary nine-foot tall monster, right?
 What’s up with that straightforward reaction?
 Well, it’s a legend, so it’ll probably get off eventually…
 Don’t be so irresponsible!
 H-Hang in there, Naruto…
 We’ll be cheering you on from behind the scenes.
 Come up close rather than behind the scene, damn it!
 What is it?
 I won’t lose, you know!
 This isn’t a weight, man!
 What is it, Hinata?
 Naruto… I heard a strange rumor.
 A strange rumor…you say?
 That you…umm…had a child.
 Oh. You mean this?
 Huh?! Hinata!
 Hey! You okay?! Hinata!
 Hinata, Hinata!
 Hinata?!
 What’s the deal? You’re sure an extravagant guy…
 Oh!
 Am I going to have to take a bath every time he pees on me?
 Ichiraku Ramen
 You know, we don’t allow pets.
 The Leaf Village public health department is strict, you see.
 I missed dinner because of him.
 Overlook it just for today.
 But now that I look closer, he’s cute, isn’t he?
 So, what’s his name?
 He’s saying it himself, so I guess Onbu is okay.
 Onbu, huh…?
 Doesn’t he want to eat some Naruto fish cake?
 Here.
 Old man! Give me a whole roll of Naruto!
 Coming right up!
 Ever since you clung to my back,
 I’ve been getting nothing but odd jobs like this.
 Well, I guess it can’t be helped…
 He’s gotten big…! And so quickly…
 This is bad!
 Naruto Uzumaki, you are assigned a mission
 for the removal of the mountain bandits from Yamabuki Pass!
 Removal? Hey old lady…
 Onbu’s gotten big,
 so you intend to get rid of the troublemaker, right?
 N-No, it’s not like that.
 I was thinking you’ve had some eye-opening growth recently, so.
 Then, what about the other members?
 No…
 Since you’ve shown such remarkable growth,
 a solo infiltration should be fine.
 Sure enough, it’s getting rid of the troublemaker!
 This is also fate… Okay now, back to work.
 Thanks, mister!
 N-Naruto, Naruto.
 Things are fun when you’re around, Onbu!
 That Grandma Tsunade.
 Don’t think you were able to get rid of the troublemaker so easily.
 I’ll beat the mountain bandits and finish up this mission lickety-split
 and the two of us will return to the Leaf Village with pride!
 Right, Onbu?!
 Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!
 Who’re you, creep?!
 Who’re you?!
 What do you want?!
 I’m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!
 Prepare yourselves!
 – Say what?! 					– Get him!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu! 184.01	02:29:44:16	02:29:45:10	Onbu!
 Even knowing it’s a clone…
 I won’t forgive those who hurt Onbu!
 Heh! How was that?!
 Die!
 Onbu! You saved me!
 Onbu… I owe you my life.
 Let’s get back to the village quick and surprise everyone!
 Onbu! No way will I believe that you’re a dangerous creature!
 We’ll go as the Onbu-Naruto team succeeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!
 What was that?
 It’s okay…
 You’ve got me with you.
 Onbu?! No, it’s huge!
 Could it be…you’re after Onbu?
 Are you Onbu’s mom?!
 W-W-W-Wait! I didn’t steal him!
 Onbu! Say something, will you?!
 Y-You idiot, Onbu!
 No, y- you’ve got the wrong idea!
 Onbu, it’s your mom.
 It’s not my intention!
 Damn it! I had a rough time of it.
 If you're a mother,
 then take better care of your child, really!
 It’s okay! I’ll return Onbu to you! So rest easy.
 Huh? My body got light.
 Huh? Onbu? You got so big!
 Huh, wha--? What’s the matter, Onbu?!
 What’s the deal?!
 W-W-W-Wait… Onbu, it’s me! Can’t you tell?!
 We were getting along so well just a moment ago!
 Please remember me!
 It’s me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!
 Oh, yeah! Naruto!
 Naruto! Naruto!
 Onbu, look at this!
 Remember! Remember this spiral!
 Naruto, Naruto!
 You remember my back you clung to the whole time, don’t you?
 Have I…had it?
 Onbu…
 I’m tired…
 This feels kind of good…
 It’s like I’m being carried piggyback.
 Onbu…
 Onbu!
 Live in good health with your mom.
 All right!
 My sides…are splitting!
 Onbaa is now no longer a legend.
 They’re thriving in the village forest and seriously proliferating.
 The stupid eagles carried them in, so.
 Naruto! How’d you tear it off you?! Tell me!
 Who knows? All I did was wrestle with Onbu.
 Don’t be so mean!
 At this rate, the village will be crushed.
 Tell me! Naruto!
 Don’t look at me.

 In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.
 Yellow Moon.
 Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes
 Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.
 Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back
 Look at my eyes, when can we meet?
 EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of
 Right away, my messy feelings as is,
 A magical chord change, in a restless city
 A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key
 Shino and I have been sent to a certain village to deal with
 a dispute over a family head who passed away.
 An old woman suddenly appears on the road and says this to us.
 “Even dead men laugh in Motoyoshi Village.”
 They were mysterious words. I never imagined it at this time.
 To think I would see with my own eyes,
 a sight in this village too frightening to even talk about…
 Next: “Laughing Shino.”
 I can’t even go to the bathroom alone at night.

 I will go by myself.
 Wait. 					I 'll go too.
 I promised Hinata that I would definitely protect you, Princess!
 With Hinata…?
 She fought with the second Janin and got hurt badly…
 Hinata did…?
 You guys said that you didn’t accept the mission of protecting me.
 Then why do you concern yourselves with me…?
 I…
 Not only me, but Hinata and Choji, too.
 We don't like it when somebody before us is hurt or sad… That's all.
 Well, let’s go!
 If we pass through the valley ahead of us,
 we’ll get to the town.
 If we do that,
 they probably won’t chase us all the way there!
 Forecast: Death! Cloudy with Chance of Sun!
 Too bad, but you guys won’t be able to reach that village.
 Since you guys are going to die here!
 Wh-Why is he floating in the air?
 Hey kid, I bet a low-class Ninja like you can’t even imagine my Jutsu.
 Take this!
 Naruto!
 I’m okay.
 But what just flew at me?
 Don’t waste your time fighting me.
 I have already captured all three of your friends.
 What?
 Just hand over the girl.
 If you do that I’ll spare your friends.
 Choji and Hinata…
 So, what are you going to do kid?
 Naruto… Are you going to abandon me too?
 Oh no, this princess is telling you to save her,
 and let your friends die.
 Well, I don’t mind that kind of thinking since it’s the same as mine.
 Same as yours?
 That’s right.
 If someone is useful,
 then you should make use of them
 even though they may be your siblings.
 There is one thing I need to thank you guys for.
 Thank us? 					For what?!
 For doing in Ruiga and Jiga.
 I was going to put an end to them myself sooner or later anyways.
 What…?!
 It was clear that they would soon tell me,
 “Big Brother, give us the property and the money too.”
 Three feudal lords are not necessary in one country.
 And you still call yourselves brothers?!
 It doesn’t matter.
 Even though it’s my parents or my brothers.
 I'll make use of anything I can.
 Now, give her to me.
 I refuse.
 I see.
 Naruto…
 A person who would abandon his siblings
 would never keep his promise with me.
 Well, that’s true.
 It’s impossible, Naruto!
 You don’t even know what kind of Jutsu it is!
 That doesn’t matter!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Take this!
 What is this guy?
 There’s something hard around his body that I can’t see…
 Naruto!
 I'm sorry, but none of your Ninjutsu work on me.
 Not even one.
 Damn it!
 What?!
 What is that?
 Crystallized ice…?
 I can gather water vapor in the air
 and instantly turn it into crystallized ice.
 So the things that just attacked me were ice Shuriken.
 Man! It’s hard to see if it’s transparent ice.
 Just that is not too interesting.
 What is this great sense of danger?
 I’m sure his Jutsu has already started!
 Where is it, where is it coming from?!
 Kid, do you know today's weather forecast?
 Weather forecast?
 Cloudy and partly sunny.
 It’s a good weather for you to die.
 What is this?
 What?!
 Look out!
 Damn it!
 Naruto!
 That’s a lens!
 Lens?!
 Yup, I turned the crystallized ice into lens
 to gather the sunlight and shoot it.
 So, I can’t really control it, but it’ll be an instant when you die.
 As soon as the battle condition at the Land of Green is prepared,
 I’ll burn up the surrounding countries with this Jutsu.
 This way!
 It’s no use.
 I could even see things that are a thousand miles away.
 I found you.
 Naruto… Why do you protect me?
 I wonder why…
 I don’t know either.
 Naruto…
 Haruna!
 While I distract him, run!
 Don’t even think you guys could get away from my Jutsu
 by doing that!
 You decided to hand me over the princess?
 Who would hand over Haruna to the likes of you!
 What a fool.
 I’m telling you that if you hand me the selfish princess
 and just go back to the village, I’ll let your friends go.
 I promised with Hinata that I will save Haruna!
 Just to keep a promise with your friend,
 you’re gonna risk your life to fight in a hopeless battle, huh…?
 You’re just like the feudal lord in Land of Green.
 A good-natured big fool!
 Same as my father…?!
 You’re just like the feudal lord in Land of Green.
 A good-natured big fool!
 Same as my father…?!
 This is what the feudal lord foolishly said
 to us who were trying to take over the Land of Green:
 “Please do not torment the people in this country.”
 I beg you!
 I don’t care what happens to me,
 but please promise me one thing!
 This is a small weak country surrounded by big countries.
 Without the powers of the people, the country cannot prosper!
 In order for the country to prosper,
 we must take care of each individual people
 and not sacrifice a single life!
 I want you to consider the people as a family
 and not torment them.
 I am the feudal lord!
 It doesn’t matter what I do to the people, right?
 That’s why…
 That's why this country has been at peace until now!
 Peace doesn’t matter to me.
 All I need to do is use the people as the stepping stones
 and feather my nest!
 And because of that kind of good nature,
 his daughter was taken as a hostage!
 What do you mean?!
 It seems like it was ten years ago.
 A lot of the people were sacrificed by the pressure of the big country…
 Riots occurred in the country and the country came close to corruption.
 It was a bitter decision…
 I had no choice but to let my daughter,
 who is more important than my life, taken as a hostage.
 I know that Haruna will not forgive me…
 A cold-hearted father who sacrificed his own daughter
 just for the peace of the country.
 Why don’t you ask your daughter directly?!
 In the after life!
 My father was…killed!
 What an outrageously good-natured person, huh?
 You’re wrong, he was a great feudal lord!
 Naruto…
 Listen!
 There are two kinds of human beings in this world.
 Those who use others, and those who get used!
 In my case, I will get to the top using anyone,
 whether it’s my parents or my friends.
 You! I’ll never forgive you!
 Shut up!
 D-Damn…!
 Die!
 Naruto…
 You can’t move anymore?!
 You’re not the one…
 It was because of Haruna’s father that this country was peaceful…
 The person who is going to succeed this country is…
 The person is…
 Haruna!
 Stop!
 Stupid!
 Why aren’t you running away?!
 Kill me! If you kill me, your goal will be fulfilled, right?!
 Naruto, Naruto has nothing to do with this!
 So both the parent and daughter are naïve, after all.
 Why not complain to your father in the afterlife
 for making you sacrifice your life for the country?
 How scary…
 Y-You!
 It’s time for you to die, kid.
 I’m not a kid!
 My name is Naruto Uzumaki.
 I’m not going to hand over the Land of Green
 to a person like you!
 Naruto!
 Die!
 What?!
 No…way…
 But kid, it’s too late even though you took me down…
 The Land of Green without a feudal lord will collapse
 due to the war between the large countries over its territory.
 It’s too bad, but that’s not gonna happen!
 Shizune!
 It’s a pain, but we came to get you guys!
 Shikamaru!
 But…I didn’t ask you guys to come get us!
 But you look pretty beaten up.
 No no, this is…
 Naruto!
 Choji! Hinata! Yurinojou!
 Everyone was safe!
 Yeah.
 We were rescued by the people of Leaf Village.
 Huh? Oh yeah, why are you guys here?
 We received notice of a coup in the Land of Green
 and Lady Tsunade herself ordered me to come…
 Princess Haruna’s father was very kind to Lady Tsunade and me.
 My father…?
 Please forgive us, when we arrived, your father was already…
 I see…I’ve caused so much trouble for you.
 Damn!
 The position of the feudal lord that I finally got a hold of…
 But, then the surrounding countries are not going to stay quiet.
 It’s okay.
 An announcement has been sent out to the neighboring countries
 in the name of the next feudal lord.
 Under your name, Princess Haruna.
 Then we don’t need to worry about the country getting attacked anymore!
 Haruna!
 Haruna…
 Do it.
 You want to take revenge with your own hands, right?
 I’ll do the same if I were you.
 I am…not like you!
 Haruna…
 Kikunojou, please forgive me.
 Princess Haruna.
 Here, Kikunojou could look over the Land of Green.
 I'm sure that Kikunojou will watch over everyone forever.
 Well, Lady Haruna, we are leaving now.
 Thank you, Naruto, Choji, and Hinata.
 Shizune, I’d like to ask a special favor.
 What is it, Princess Haruna?
 My role is to take over my father’s will to protect the peace of Land of Green.
 In order to do that,
 I want to borrow some help from the Leaf Village.
 Our help?
 Yes.
 I want you to lend me Naruto.
 Huh?!
 Please, Naruto.
 Princess Haruna.
 I want you to help me with the revival of the Land of Green.
 I…I…
 I’m sorry, but I can’t really do that.
 I need to go back to my friends.
 And I need to do more training and become much stronger.
 There are things that I must do.
 It’s all for my precious friends!
 Then I can’t take you away from them…
 Naruto, I’ll promise that I will do my best to keep my father’s wishes
 and strive for a peaceful country where no one will be sacrificed.
 Yeah!
 It’s a promise!
 Thank you! Naruto!
 Good-bye! Everybody!
 We’ll come back someday!
 Bye!
 See ya!

 No, no, no. This is my limit.

190,"Rock away your existence,
 Shouting that you are here…
 A new journey begins now.
 As we survived through the changing seasons,
 we gained knowledge and strength, (just looks like a survival game)
 But the forgotten memories,
 of the feelings abandoned within the flows of time,
 have also been lost.
 When sinking down, we learned loneliness.
 But now we’ve met each other, we are no longer alone.
 Unveil your feelings, Those high emotions
 Those tears will change your fate.
 Pound your heartbeat against the darkness,
 We’re sure to meet, Under the same flag of pain
 A coup at the Land of Green…?
 Yes, it seems there’s no mistake.
 The retainers conspired with some men
 and began a rebellion…
 What happened to Naruto and the others?
 Speculating from their gathering point,
 they are around here.
 So they’ve already crossed the border…
 The large countries have agreed to make this
 a demilitarized zone.
 Considering Naruto and the other’s mission,
 they should be in a safe area…
 Are you sure?
 What do you mean…?
 Don’t you think the timing of this request
 strangely overlaps with the coup?
 Then you’re saying that Naruto’s mission is also related to this case?
 There is a possibility…
 But there’s no time to deal with Naruto at the moment.
 We have to take back the Land of Green
 from the rebels as soon as possible.
 If we leave it like this,
 the flames of the war will eventually reach other countries…
 True…
 Shizune, gather the free villagers
 and have them head to the Land of Green immediately!
 Yes, ma'am!
 You’ve done it now!
 What a persistent brat…!
 You shouldn't be able to stand anymore…
 Naruto!
 This is…nothing.
 What a surprise… you got some guts.
 Then, take this too!
 Ninja Art Magnet! Electromagnetic Illusion.
 Naruto!
 It’s useless! Your voice wouldn’t reach him!
 The human brain functions by
 a faint electric current running through it…
 If you receive my magnetic force powder,
 it’s going to alter your electric current and stop your thinking…
 That chain also has a strong magnetic force.
 Now, get buried!
 Naruto!
 Are you okay?
 Thank goodness…
 Hinata…run!
 I can’t leave you behind…
 He is…
 He’s someone that you can’t deal with…
 Naruto… I promise I’ll save you!
 Hinata!
 I’ll have you tell me where that girl is!
 Byakugan!
 Take this! Electromagnetic Illusion!
 Protective 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!
 What?!
 I see, so that is the Byakugan of the Village Hidden in Leaves…
 How interesting!
 What wonderful Taijutsu, but…
 I’ll crush it with my power!
 I did it…?!
 Yeah right… That level of Taijutsu will not work!
 It’s useless!
 This is bad…!
 You’re not much of a challenge. I’m disappointed!
 Now tell me! Where did you hide that girl?
 If you answer me, I’ll let you live… That boy too!
 If you rescue him right now, he wouldn’t die.
 Run…Hinata…
 Now say it!
 You don’t want to save that boy?
 Or do you think you could win against me?
 If I say it… Naruto would never forgive me.
 Then I’ll force you to talk!
 I’ll change the area behind you into a powerful magnet.
 I can change the position of the magnet according to your movement.
 So it's a waste to run away!
 That brat…
 She evaded the attack by throwing a paper bomb at that very instant.
 She’s pretty quick witted.
 But…
 I won’t let you go!
 Hinata…
 Naruto… I promise that I’ll return to rescue you…!
 But, there is a huge difference in power between him and me…
 I could never win against him!
 He’s already caught up to me… What should I do?
 This is…iron sand…?
 I see…his Jutsu can change his body
 and the things he touches into magnet.
 The reason why he didn’t attack back there
 was to brush off the iron sand from his body…
 If he doesn’t, he would sink in his iron sand.
 His attack pattern consists of alternating between
 Ninja Art Magnet and Iron Sand Genjutsu …
 He does this to turn his magnet powers on and off
 so his body won’t completely turn into a magnet.
 Then, there is one way to beat him!
 Now…play time is almost over!
 Now, it’s time you give up!
 I would never give up!
 Because that is my Ninja Way!
 What a waste…
 How dare you do that to Naruto!
 I will definitely not forgive you!
 Once you say where that girl is,
 why don’t you live with that brat in hell!
 Hey, don’t be shy and come closer!
 Right now!
 I’ll risk everything in this single attack!
 An attack that didn’t work before,
 will never work!
 Is…that right?
 What?!
 We're both going to hell!
 Let go, you!
 You brat! How dare you play around with me!
 I changed my mind. I’ll finish you off now!
 What is this?!
 Just now… I struck a Chakra Point
 that would make your Chakra flow go out of control.
 Now your body will just turn into a strong magnet…
 What…? That’s why you brought me to this sandy area?!
 S-Stop!
 I did it…Naruto…
 Damn…! I can’t move!
 The Human Boulder!
 Naruto!
 Choji…!
 Are you okay, Naruto…?
 Thanks…Yurinojou.
 So what happened?
 The second Janin attacked me and I got beaten up.
 What happened to Hinata and the princess?
 Oh yeah…!
 I can’t stay here!
 What…? What’s going on…? Naruto?
 Hinata is in danger!
 –Oh! Naruto! 					–Naruto!
 Hinata!
 Are you okay…Hinata?
 Hang in there, Hinata!
 N-Naruto… Choji…
 Yurinojou…
 You guys… you guys came to rescue me…
 Of course… We’re friends, right?!
 Yes!
 By the way, that magnet guy… Where did he go?
 He probably sunk into the sand…
 What?! You did it, Hinata?
 Yeah… I did my best…
 Hinata, you’re great…
 The guy that I couldn’t handle…
 You’re complimenting me?
 Naruto…
 Here…
 This is…my forehead band?
 The mission is not over yet.
 Naruto, please protect the princess… Princess Haruna.
 Hinata…
 I’ll promise you!
 I swear on this forehead band I will definitely protect the Princess!
 And…
 I can’t be losing against you!
 Naruto…
 Look after Hinata, Choji…Yurinojou!
 Right!
 Leave it to us…Naruto!
 Well, I’ll be darned.
 I can’t believe that Ruiga and Jiga were both defeated.
 Well, that saves some trouble though…
 Nobody has ever escaped from my Jutsu.
 Today will be a good day.
 Haruna! Where are you?!
 There she is!
 Haruna! Get a hold of yourself!
 Are you okay?
 I’m glad…
 I-It’s me, Princess Haruna!
 N-Naruto…
 I came to rescue you,
 but what is this treatment?
 Sorry…
 Why did you escape by yourself?
 I can’t count on you guys…
 I will try to survive no matter who's sacrificed…
 As long as I survive, the Land of Green can be revived.
 That’s the most important thing, right?!
 I am a victim!
 If I declare that other countries will lend me their power.
 If I take back the country and
 I, the true successor, become the feudal lord,
 then people will definitely gather and
 the Land of Green will return to the way it was!
 I don’t think so.
 You’re saying that the Land of Green won’t revive?
 I’m not saying that…
 But I just thought what if I lived in the Land of Green…
 If I was a Ninja just like Yurinojou…
 I won’t guard a feudal lord like you!
 Naruto!
 What do you know?! What do you know about me?!
 What do you know about my life as a hostage?!
 Under watch 24/7,
 not even allowed to have my own free time,
 I was lonely everyday.
 Because of that lifestyle,
 I became sick and was in bed for a long time.
 I was finally able to return home after being close to dying…
 Naruto! If you’re saying that I’m wrong, then answer me!
 Were the things done to me
 in the name of protecting the Land of Green all wrong?!
 Then why did my father and mother send me away as a hostage?!
 Answer me! Naruto!
 I won’t count on you.
 I will go by myself.
 Wait. 					I will go too.
 I promised Hinata that I will definitely protect you, princess!
 With Hinata…?
 She fought with the second Janin
 and got hurt badly....
 Hinata did…?
 You guys said that you didn’t accept the mission of protecting me.
 Then, why do you concern yourselves with me?
 I…
 Not only me, but Hinata and Choji, too.
 We don't like it when somebody before us is hurt or sad… That's all.
 Well, let’s go!
 If we pass through the valley ahead of us,
 we’ll get to the town.
 If we do that, they probably won't chase us all the way there!
 Please be careful…
 No one uses this deer path.
 This should shake them…
 I found you!
 It’s impossible… to run away from me!
 Choji?!
 Don’t make useless efforts…
 I’ll make you guys my hostages!
 You guys take them back to the castle!
 Yes!
 If you wander around me
 you might get caught in my Jutsu and die.
 That’s it… We’re almost there!
 There’s no time to waste! Let’s go!
 Okay!
 Haruna!
 I’m okay!
 Oh no!
 Wh-What is this?!
 I see… You have good sense to dodge that attack!
 Who is it?! 					Where are you?!
 Here, over here!
 Too bad, but you guys won’t be able to reach that village.
 Since you guys are going to die here!

 What do you mean by monitoring Akamaru?
 You know about the incident
 where someone from outside infiltrated the village, right?
 Yeah, I know about that.
 But I heard that Kiba and the others resolved that incident without any trouble.
 That’s right.
 Damn! That Kiba!
 I want a mission where I totally kick an enemy’s butt.
 To be exact, that’s wrong.
 What?
 Before Kiba and the others had the intruder in custody…
 he swallowed a pellet and killed himself.
 What? Suicide…?
 In the investigation that followed,
 it was revealed that the enemy was a Shinobi
 from another land that uses a unique tactic.
 Perhaps he took his own life in order to seal that power.
 What’s the “unique” tactic?
 Something you would call a biological weapon.
 Biological weapon?
 It’s a particular pathogen…
 a terrible weapon where someone infected will gradually lose oneself
 and have their body taken over.
 But how is that connected with monitoring Akamaru?
 Could it be that Akamaru was…?!
 There’s a possibility he’s infected.
 He still doesn’t look so well.
 Y-Yeah…
 Since Akamaru’s not in his best condition,
 I’m skipping training today as well.
 Okay…
 Oh!
 Wh-What’re you doing, Shino?!
 Shino, do something quick!
 Shino!
 The insects suddenly stopped listening to me.
 Jeez, give me a break.
 I’m sorry.
 We’ll head back early for the time being. See ya.
 I hope… Akamaru gets better soon.
 Shino?
 It’s the first time the insects have attacked a comrade…
 What is it, Akamaru?
 Oh, shoot! I’ve been spotted!
 What’re you doing, Naruto?
 Wh-What, you ask?
 I’m developing a new Jutsu, believe it!
 So as for me, I’m busy and…
 Kiba's Long Day
 Is there no mistake, Sis?
 I’d say the possibility at this point is around fifty-fifty.
 I still haven’t been able to identify it,
 but these are the lab results of the blood drawn from Akamaru…
 But! It could be some kind of mistake!
 Do you think I, a veterinarian, would make such a mistake?
 Yeah… You’re right.
 What is it, Akamaru?!
 Let go! Let go!
 Akamaru, it’s Naruto. It’s okay to let go.
 Hey, Akamaru!
 Akamaru!
 What did you do that for Akamaru?
 I mean, what’re you doing in the front yard of my house?
 Huh? Well, that’s…
 Anyway, come in.
 For the time being, I have to fulfill my responsibility as the owner.
 What?
 What?!
 Geez! Biting a comrade of the same village can’t be allowed!
 Are you training him properly, Kiba?!
 All right.
 It’s finished! Perfect if I do say so myself!
 Sis! That looks just like a surgical scar!
 What? Really? I thought it turned out well, though…
 Sorry, Naruto.
 Have Sakura or someone patch them up for you!
 Hm? Right…
 See ya.
 Right.
 See you later too, Miss Hana!
 Akamaru…
 I’m telling you,
 there’s nothing else other than my pants getting all torn up.
 Shino’s insects attacked Akamaru…
 He even attacked Naruto, whom he should know very well.
 There’s trouble, Lady Tsunade!
 It seems they were attacked by someone
 in the middle of night training.
 Looks like they launched a sneak attack with quite a few men.
 No, it seems there was just one culprit.
 What?! All of this by one person?!
 To be precise, that’s not correct.
 It’s one animal.
 There’s no doubt.
 There’s trouble, Kiba!
 You’re talking about the incident
 where Shinobi were attacked during night training last night, right…?
 It-It can’t be!
 It seems it’s as you said, Sis…
 I can smell blood from Akamaru.
 That’s Kiba Inuzuka’s Ninja Hound Akamaru, correct?
 You jerks. What do you want with Akamaru?!
 A warrant…?
 Kiba…!
 Yes, there’s no mistake.
 Kiba Inuzuka, by order of the Hokage,
 the Ninja Hound Akamaru is to be kept
 under the supervision of the Anbu Black Ops.
 – Damn it! 					– Kiba!
 We should obey the Lady Hokage’s order.
 Damn it!
 Akamaru…
 Here.
 Thanks, Sis.
 This contains medicine that I prepared,
 so give it to the vet over there.
 Right. I’m off, then.
 Naruto…?
 What’s the idea of Akamaru being detained?!
 Akamaru is the culprit from last night’s incident.
 We have sufficient proof as well.
 At this point, it’s an unavoidable measure.
 The Medical Team is now desperately looking for a way to save Akamaru.
 Don’t worry too much.
 If…that doesn’t work either, what’ll happen to Akamaru?
 At that time…
 there’ll be nothing left to do but to put Akamaru down!
 Hidden Leaf Veterinary Hospital
 You don’t need to worry.
 The Medical Corps will figure something out soon.
 Right…
 Take care on your way home.
 Right.
 Akamaru…
 I won’t hand you over to anyone.
 It seems Kiba Inuzuka has taken Akamaru and fled.
 Lady Tsunade, what shall we do?
 In preparation for the worst,
 have the Special Pursuit Corps stand by here!
 The Special Pursuit Corps…
 C-Could it be that you’re really going to kill Akamaru…Grandma?
 Grandma Tsunade!
 It’s hard for me, too.
 Damn it!
 Did you find them?!
 No!
 Kiba!
 Kiba!
 He’s rapidly getting worse.
 Akamaru!
 Where are they?
 They should be around here.
 I swore to protect him, no matter what!
 I swore never I’d never let him go through that experience ever again…!
 The Special Pursuit Corps has assembled.
 Show the team in.
 Kiba!
 Where are you?!
 I guess I was able to hide my tracks somewhat…
 This is a serum for Akamaru that the Medical Corps whipped up.
 I can’t guarantee the level of effect.
 There’s maybe a fifty-percent chance of survival.
 There’s also a risk of side-effects
 that would cause Akamaru to go even more berserk.
 In the event that happens…
 It’s an unavoidable measure, but Akamaru must…
 Reporting!
 The Akamaru Pursuit Corps has lost the trail of Kiba and Akamaru.
 Lady Tsunade.
 That way?!
 Akamaru…
 Kiba!
 Wh-What’s that?
 It’s Akamaru…
 But…
 I won’t hand over Akamaru to anyone!
 What’re you doing?!
 Have you come to kill Akamaru?!
 No! I just came out of concern!
 You lie! The Lady Hokage said it, didn’t she?!
 There’ll be nothing else to do but to kill Akamaru.
 You came to dispose of Akamaru, right?!
 I won’t hand over Akamaru to anyone!
 This isn’t the time to be doing that!
 Something called the Special Pursuit Corps or whatever is coming after Akamaru!
 What?!
 The Pursuit Corps should be here soon.
 Akamaru will really be in trouble if that happens!
 You and I have to do something before that!
 This isn’t the time to be fighting!
 Shut up!
 Why don’t you get it, Kiba?!
 Shut up!
 All right! I’ve sighted Akamaru!
 Kiba, Naruto! You guys step back!
 C-Could it be…the Pursuit Corps is…
 Sis!
 You gotta be… joking, right?
 Sis!
 What’re you going to do to Akamaru with that?
 This is medicine I received from the Hokage.
 I’m going to inject it into Akamaru.
 Then Akamaru will be saved?!
 The probability is fifty-fifty.
 If it fails and side-effects are produced,
 Akamaru’s symptoms will get even worse.
 All we can do now is take a chance on this.
 If the worst happens and it fails…
 You understand, right, Kiba?
 Damn it…
 Even if it’s only fifty percent,
 there’s a possibility that Akamaru will be saved.
 We’ve gotta do this! I’ll also help out, miss!
 Shadow Clone Jutsu!
 Kiba, what about you?!
 If you’re not going to do anything, you’re in the way, so beat it!
 Let’s go, Kiba.
 Just leave that coward be.
 You’re ready, right? Let’s go, Naruto!
 We’ll save you now, Akamaru!
 Aim for the legs! lmmobilize Akamaru!
 Right!
 Since it’s come to this, I have no choice.
 I must terminate Akamaru.
 Stop!
 I said stop… Akamaru.
 Kiba!
 Kiba?
 Akamaru…
 Have you forgotten…my scent?
 We were always together from when we were little, weren’t we?
 Akamaru…
 Why…why…did you become like this?
 Please remember… Akamaru!
 Kiba!
 I'm sorry, Akamaru…
 I put you through nothing but painful experiences.
 I’m sorry, Akamaru… I couldn’t protect you…
 I’m sorry… Akamaru…
 I'm a terrible master.
 But…
 I’ll…always be with you.
 Kiba…
 Kiba!
 It really would’ve been touch and go
 if the Medical Corps had been even a little late in arriving.
 Without a doubt,
 he would’ve lost his life if Akamaru’s attack had hit Kiba’s vital spot…
 Really, it could have been much worse.
 That’s wrong…
 Huh? Kiba?!
 When he came at me with his final attack,
 Akamaru just barely missed my vital spots.
 He drained all his remaining strength in order to desperately control himself.
 Akamaru was battling desperately with himself.
 That’s admirable, Akamaru!
 Thanks…

 You’ve passed through the gates!
 The first test for the Chunin Exams has been completed…
 I wish you well.
 All right! Wish us well!
 What a funny guy…
 Huh…
 I didn’t think that there would be a guy who would pass the first test
 with a blank test sheet.
 Naruto Uzumaki. He really is a funny guy.
 The Chunin Exam Stage 2: The Forest of Death!
 There’s something kind of creepy about this place.
 This place is called the Forest of Death, you’ll soon realize why.
 “The Forest of Death, you’ll soon realize why.”
 That kind of threat won’t work on me one bit!
 I’m not scared!
 Really?
 You’ve got a lot of energy.
 A kid like you dies at very beginning,
 dappled with the red blood I like.
 I’m returning your…Kunai Knife…
 Thank you for taking the trouble…
 But…don’t stand behind me, thirsty for blood.
 If you don’t want a quick death…
 Well, it’s my nature to act up at the sight of red blood.
 And my precious hair was cut, so I got excited…
 Naruto…
 I’m sorry…
 W-What with that Proctor?
 Frankly, she’s psycho!
 This one, too…
 That girl, why was her tongue so long?
 Evidently, we’ve got a lot of hot-blooded kids this time.
 This will be fun.
 You’re the most hot-blooded! Believe it!
 Well, before we start the second exam, I have to pass this out to you!
 It’s a consent form,
 before you can take part in the test you have to sign this.
 Why?
 From here on out, corpses are going to come out,
 I have to get your consent to that!
 Or it’ll be my responsibility.
 Well, I’m going to start the explanation for the second exam.
 In a word, the limits of your survival will be challenged.
 Survival, huh? This test is a total pain.
 First, I’ll give you step-by-step instruction on the terrain of this Training Field.
 Training Field Number 44 is surrounded by 44 locked entrance gates,
 there are rivers and a forest and a tower in the middle.
 It’s about 10 kilometers from the towers to the gate…
 In this confined area, you will go through a certain survival program.
 The contents of which are…
 anything goes scroll battle!
 Scroll…?
 Yes…
 I want you to fight for two scrolls, the Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.
 All together 26 teams got through the first test.
 Half of them...
 13 teams get the Heaven scroll, the other half get the Earth Scroll.
 I’ll hand over one scroll to each team.
 To put it simply,  that’s what you’re vying for.
 And the conditions to pass?
 Three of you bring both the Heaven and Earth Scrolls to the tower in the center.
 That means that of the 13 teams, half of them will fail for sure…
 Except it has to be in time.
 For this second exam, the time limit is 120 hours.
 Do it in exactly five days!
 Five days.
 What do we do about food?
 Be self-sufficient! It’s a treasure trove in the wilderness.
 There’s more than enough for food…
 However…
 It’s teeming with fierce people-eating animals,
 poison bugs, poisonous weeds and much more.
 No way…
 Fool, that’s why it’s called survival!
 Besides, it’s improbable that 39 people, 13 teams will pass.
 The interval for activity gets longer with passing each day,
 while the time for recovery gets shorter…
 Seems pretty grueling!
 On top of that, you’re surrounded by nothing but enemies,
 even falling asleep will be a problem…
 And, besides those injured during attempts to capture scrolls…
 there will definitely be people
 are unable to endure the rigors of the course.
 Umm…so you can quit in the middle of it?
 According to the rules, you cannot give up in the middle of it!
 I want you to spend five days in the forest.
 Just like I thought…
 This is going to be a pain!
 Moving on, conditions of disqualification.
 Number 1, if all three members of the team can’t make it to the tower
 with the Heaven and Earth Scrolls within the time limit.
 Number 2, if a team loses a member or if a member became incapacitated.
 There’s that, and this is a supplement…
 Absolutely do not look at the contents of the scrolls
 until you have reached the tower!
 W-What happens if we look at it halfway through?
 When you look at it you’ll find…out!
 Huh?
 There are times when a Chunin must deal with super-secret text.
 This is to test your reliability.
 That’s all the explanation!
 I’ll exchange your three consent forms for the scrolls in that hut over there.
 After that, pick your entrance, and all the gates will open simultaneously!
 Finally, just a word of advice…
 Don’t die!
 I see, so you won’t know which scroll was given to each team…
 and you won’t know which of the three people is carrying the scroll.
 If what Ibiki said was right,
 there will be life or death struggles for information in this test.
 Everyone is an enemy!
 The resolve of everyone here is strong.
 That means that it might come to killing each other.
 It looks like they understand the meaning of the consent form a little bit…
 Heeey, look who’s here!
 It’s Billboard Brow, isn’t it?
 I thought you went home long ago, I never imagined you were still here.
 Ooooh? Look who’s here, the ugly Inopig.
 Starting now, it's five days of the survival test with Sasuke.
 There’s no reason to go home.
 – Ugly! 					– Billboard!
 – Ugly! Ugly! – Billboard! Billboard!
 – Ugly, ugly, ugly! – Billboard, billboard, billboard!
 – Billboard, billboard, billboard! – Ugly ugly ugly!
 – Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly! – Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!
 Sakura, this is impossible for you.
 For your own sake, just hurry up and go home!
 I could say the exact same thing to you!
 Hey, why are those two on such bad terms?
 D-Do you think I care about something stupid like that?
 Man…all there is to do is write my name,
 why does it take this much time!
 Hey! Hinata! What are you doing over there?
 N-Naruto…
 Umm…uhhhh…well…
 Just like I thought, this kid is strange.
 A scratch…
 Uh-um… this…is--
 See ya!
 Naruto…
 It’s about time for the scroll exchange.
 Well, I wonder how many teams will survive…
 Teams who have taken the scroll,
 stay with the representative and move to the gate!
 We’ll all start simultaneously in 30 minutes!!
 Yeah! Survival is our forte!
 Hinata, don’t show your weakness.
 Uh, okay…
 Life or death…
 It’s a pain but we just have to do this.
 Since it’s come to this, Naruto will be our target.
 For snacks, there’s potato chips...
 – What about shortcake...? – I can’t believe you two!
 Okaaaay! I won’t lose!
 I’ll bring down whoever comes near me.
 – Yes! 					– Cha!
 Heh heh…finally the opportunity is here…
 We have the chance to fulfill our mission in earnest…
 Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,
 I’m really scared of spending five days with this guy.
 Target the rookies first.
 They said that from now on it’s okay to kill,
 which makes it easier.
 Master Guy, I’ll do my best! I’ll definitely succeed!
 We now start the second test of the Chunin Exam!
 Look for the brats!
 Those three, right?
 All right! Let’s go!
 Okay! First, we search for that thing.
 Can you do it, Hinata?
 Yes.
 Byakugan!
 Slow down, Lee! We just started.
 I know. But…
 I can’t stay still!
 Who knows what kind of powerful foe is waiting for us.
 Hot-blooded fool…
 As you already understand, we have only one target!
 W-What are you doing, Choji?
 Just a little break… I’m already tired, and hungry…
 What are you suddenly saying?!
 It hasn’t been five minutes since we started!
 But I can’t help it. I’m hungry…
 You! If you were able to bring snacks,
 you should have been able to bring one Kunai knife!
 Ino! Hide!
 Uh-oh!
 This kind of thing continuing  for five days…?
 Anyway, the tower is the goal for everyone, right?
 So it would be clever for us to make a trap in the vicinity of the tower.
 Okay…wasting no time, huh?
 Where are they?
 Heh…kids.
 It’s like begging to be found, standing in that conspicuous place.
 They sensed our presence,
 but, evidently they haven’t grasped where we are.
 What happened? 					You’re pale.
 W-What is that?!
 The Flying Leeches of Leaf Village sense body temperature and perspiration,
 then in mass, swoop down on their prey.
 If they continue to suck your blood for five minutes,
 you go to the other world…
 Using this behavior,
 we’d set a trap on the path enemies would use to escape.
 D-Darn it…
 That’s one team gone!
 It sounds like they’ve already started.
 Wasn't that someone screaming just now?
 I-I’m kinda getting nervous.
 I-It was nothing. Sakura. Believe it!
 I-I have to pee…
 Y-You…fool!
 What are you doing in front of a lady!
 Go to the grass!
 Aaah, that was a lot! I’m refreshed.
 Like I said, not in front of a lady--!
 S-Sasuke… no matter what, you don’t have to go that far.
 W-What was that for…?
 What are you doing…all of a sudden?!
 What you ask? That’s my line, isn’t it?
 Sasuke!
 It can’t be helped!
 Sasuke, please stop!
 Look closely at him!
 Talk! Where’s the real Naruto!
 I have no idea what you’re talking about!
 What happened to the scratch on you face?
 I’m asking what happened to the scratch you got before from the Proctor!
 And your Shuriken holster is on your left leg.
 That guy’s right handed!
 You’re worse at transformation than Naruto, you phony!
 Unlucky! You got me. ln that case…
 Which one of you got the scroll?
 If you listen to me obediently, I’ll spare your lives.
 I see! Then I’ll resort to force!
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Aww, stupid gas mask man!
 Suddenly sneaking up on someone when they're peeing!
 I messed up just a little bit.
 Now I have to hurry and meet up with Sakura.
 Wait a minute! What is this giant snake?
 Hey! Are you serious?! Wait a minute, hey!
 I've been gulped down!
 Next episode: ""Eat or Be Eaten: Panic in the Forest""
 Will I return to action?!

 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer

 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther

 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 Where is... this place...?
 Who is it?
 Me... 					from long ago?
 Father and mother didn’t need to die!
 Everyone was killed.
 I had no power so...
 the clan vanished.
 Battle Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!
 Ino... Why?
 I can’t let you upstage me in front of Sasuke!
 Squirming again...
 The Leaf Village worms wandered in.
 What are the two of you thinking?!
 They’re bad news!
 It’s a pain, but it can’t be helped!
 Ino steps out and we men should run?
 Sorry to get you involved.
 But anyway we’re a Three-Man Squad, after all.
 We’re all in this together, aren’t we?
 Well, we’ll see.
 No! I don’t want to die yet!
 Let go of my scarf!
 You’re annoying! Quit wiggling!
 It’s okay for you to drop out, fatso.
 What did that guy just say?
 I....didn’t quite catch it.
 Huh?!
 That word is taboo to Choji.
 Try saying it again...
 I said if you have a problem, pull out, fatso.
 Fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso
 I’m not fat, I’m just big-boned! Blast it!
 Hurraaaay for Big-Boned!
 W-Wow...
 All right! You understand this, right?!
 This is a battle between Leaf and Sound!
 Lucky! He’s lost it!
 No way, this looks like it’s going to be a pain in the butt.
 That’s my line.
 I was told to get Sasuke by the end of the test...
 Sasuke...
 Sakura...
 The two behind... take care of them.
 Okay!
 Well then, Team Ino, let’s go full throttle!
 Right!
 Formation Ino!
 – Shika! 					– Cho!
 I’m counting on you, Choji
 Okay!
 Expansion Jutsu!
 Next, Leaf Style Taijutsu!
 Human Boulder!
 What is this Jutsu?
 Isn’t it just a fat guy rolling?
 Slicing Sound Wave!
 You!
 He jumped?!
 The air pressure of Slicing Sound Wave
 is less than effective against that rotation.
 Even if I do the Super Sound Wave, if I’m touched by something like that
 the bones in my arms will be crushed!
 Think I’ll let you?!
 You’re the most annoying so...
 Ninja Art!
 Shadow Possession Jutsu!
 My body!
 Huh?!
 Dosu?!
 What are you doing at a time like this?!
 Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
 Ino, next it’s just the ladies.
 Okay, Shikamaru, look after my body.
 Gotcha!
 Huh?
 Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
 Shoot!
 Kin!
 What happened?
 This... is the end of it.
 You guys!
 If you make one move,  this girl named Kin is dead meat!
 If you don’t want this to end right here,
 leave your scroll and walk away!
 Once you’ve gone far enough that I can’t feel your Chakras,
 I’ll release this girl!
 These guys... What are they grinning about?
 – Choji! 					– Yeah!
 This isn’t good! They won’t...!
 Ino!
 Uggghh. I’m dizzy.
 W-What kind of person... hurts their own comrades?
 Careless.
 Our goal is not the scrolls or to pass this test playing by the rules.
 What?
 It’s Sasuke.
 Humph...
 My Jutsu...
 So your much precious Shadow Paralysis Jutsu
 is limited to 5 minutes?
 It’s not Shadow Paralysis. lt’s Shadow Possession Jutsu.
 In addition, it seems that this girl’s Jutsu...
 seems to be a Jutsu to take over the other’s body.
 From the looks of the blood she’s spitting up,
 if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...
 Are you going to do in... your teammate?
 If I need to...
 This is no good.
 Shoot...
 That’s too bad... you’re just a step away.
 You’re too easy-going.
 Hmph, I don’t like this at all.
 You minor Sound Ninjas...
 Bullying the second-rate guys and putting on airs like a winner.
 What?!
 They're Lee’s teammates...
 Lee!
 You goofed.
 Hah! Coming out of nowhere like cockroaches...
 That kid with the bob lying over there is on our team, but...
 But you messed with him, didn’t you?!.
 What’s with his eyes?
 It’s like they see through everything...
 If you’re gonna continue,  I’ll fight with full strength!
 Huh?
 What ‘s wrong? Neji...
 This Chakra...
 If you don’t like me, don’t play cool, come down here.
 No. Evidently, there’s no need for that.
 After all...
 without power...
 I can’t do anything!
 Because I had no power... Everyone was killed!
 No... You let them be killed.
 You only... watched.
 If only I had power...
 If only I had power...
 Sasuke! You’re awake... Huh?!
 Huh?
 That’s...
 Sasuke?
 Sakura...
 Sakura...
 Who did this to you?
 Who is it?
 The Curse Marks run around his entire body?!
 Sasuke... 					That body...?
 Don’t worry.
 On the contrary, strength is rapidly flowing in...
 Right now I feel good.
 That guy gave this to me.
 Huh?
 At last I understand...
 I’m an Avenger...
 On my road, I must put power into my hands...
 even if it means abandoning myself to the devil.
 So... I see...
 So the mark on the neck that this girl called Sakura spoke of
 is this Curse Mark.
 But...
 I didn’t think he could stand up...
 Sakura, tell me...
 Who harmed you...?
 Me!
 Huh?
 Ino!
 If you stay like that you’re gonna get involved!
 Come back to this body!
 Choji, you too, come over here and hide.
 Y-Yeah.
 Uh-oh.
 Release!
 Okay, she’s back!
 Shikamaru!
 What’s going to happen now?
 How should I know?
 Wha--?!
 W-What’s this...?
 No matter...
 how you look at it....
 his Chakras are...
 too big!
 Dosu, this half-dead bastard is nothing to be scared of!
 Stop, Zaku! Don’t you understand?!
 I’ll take care of all of them...
 in one fell swoop!
 Super Sonic Slicing Wave!
 Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.
 – Who did? 					– Huh?!
 Zaku!
 He’s fast!
 Moreover, he took in those two, and in the blink of an eye.
 Fire Style!
 Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
 Don’t push your luck!
 I’ll blow them off!
 What?!
 Shuriken’s in the fire?!
 Zaku, below you!
 The quality of the Chakra  is completely different...
 Is that really Sasuke?
 What happened? What in the world...?
 It seems like you’re proud of your arms...
 You!
 S-Stop it!
 Sasuke will definitely come for me.
 You’re the only one left.
 You...
 make it a little more fun for me.
 This isn’t...
 This isn’t...
 This is not like...
 Sasuke!
 S-Stop!!
 Stop it.
 Please...
 Stop.
 The Curse Mark is withdrawing...
 We’re saved for now.
 Sasuke!
 You’re strong.
 Sasuke... We can’t defeat you the way you are now.
 This is our fee for settling this...
 Please let us withdraw from here.
 Huh?
 It seems selfish, but we now have something we need to confirm, too.
 That being said, let’s make a promise.
 If there’s another opportunity to battle with you in this test,
 we won’t run or hide.
 Wait!
 Who in the world is Orochimaru?
 What did he do to Sasuke?!
 Why Sasuke?!
 I don’t know...
 We were just given orders to make the hit on Sasuke.
 Though you ordered us to assassinate Sasuke,
 you got to him first.
 Moreover, you didn’t kill him, and left that Curse Mark instead.
 I don’t know what you’re thinking...
 Hey! Are you okay?!
 It’s a pain, but Ino, I’ll leave Lee to you.
 Got it.
 That Chakra... lt’s abnormal.
 The Uchiha clan... this good, huh?
 Sakura’s in danger!
 It’s okay... I’ll protect Sakura.
 Well, what should we do with this guy?
 Kick him awake?
 Can I do it?
 What am I...?
 Sasuke...

 Return of the Morning Mist
 My mother and my father… They didn’t have to die.
 Because I didn’t have strength, the whole clan was destroyed.
 Everyone was killed…
 Darn it…
 Morning training is over!
 Once I’ve eaten breakfast
 I’ll get back to rigorous training!
 Old man…
 Konohamaru…
 Yo! Konohomaru.
 Naruto.
 Have you already resumed studies at the academy?
 N-No, not yet.
 The school buildings are damaged, so we’re all repairing them.
 Is that so?
 How about you, Naruto? You’re already training?
 Sort of.
 Wh-What?
 What is it?
 N-No, it’s nothing…
 – Hey um…! 					– Hey um…!
 So what is it…?
 You too, Naruto, what is it?
 Nothing…really…
 I don’t feel lonely.
 Huh?
 There’s no time to be feeling lonely.
 Everyone is working really hard to rebuild the village right now.
 Konohamaru…
 Right now, I must work for the village even just a little bit.
 So Naruto, you work hard at your training too.
 If you don’t, I’ll become Hokage before you.
 Fool, I will absolutely become Hokage.
 Besides…you have to graduate from the Academy first.
 Oh, that’s right…
 Oh, here it is.
 Here, it’s for you.
 A free ramen ticket from Ichiraku…
 Is it okay?
 I already have one, so I’m giving one to you.
 Thank you, Naruto.
 Oh! Konohamaru.
 Good morning.
 I’m going to go.
 We’ll work hard again today.
 – Yep! 					– Yep!
 Today we’re fixing the blackboards.
 I brought paint.
 Well! Once I’ve eaten ramen at Ichiraku, I’ll continue training.
 This is it.
 Th-This is…
 A lot of time has passed since the death.
 It’s probably before the Chunin Exam began.
 I see, so that's it…
 That Orochimaru!
 After the murder of Lord Kazekage,
 Orochimaru… or someone like Kabuto played Kazekage…
 How thoughtless we were…
 That darn Sarutobi…
 Well, it’s not that easy.
 The one who was your opponent was the renowned Hokage,
 deemed to be strongest of all five great nations.
 However…you’ve done well. Two out of the five Kages…
 Stop…
 Stop giving me words of sympathy.
 I will kill you!
 Of course, I didn’t mean to…
 It’s true that we didn’t succeed in bringing the village down…
 On the other hand, another objective of this plan, Sasuke Uchiha…
 Your leash is now on him.
 In exchange for these arms and all of my Jutsu…
 If we could have gotten our hands on that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,
 it wouldn’t have been a problem.
 However that’s a dream that can no longer come true.
 He is stronger than I am.
 That is why…I pulled myself out from that organization…
 Kakashi, huh?
 What does he want?
 Breakfast, breakfast!
 Wait for me, my ramen.
 Do you already know his whereabouts?
 Yes.
 In that case, it will be easy…
 Let’s go.
 Here it comes, here it comes.
 Oh goodie, it’s just like I thought.
 Hidden Leaf Village… has a high average score.
 You’re still doing such a ridiculous thing?
 Well yes, this is my research.
 Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?
 I wonder what you advisers want from me.
 Surely, you know…
 without our telling you, don’t you?
 You don’t have to make such scary faces.
 I heard that the talks with Sand Village have been settled without problems.
 The Hidden Village in the Sand announced that
 everything was Orochimaru’s handiwork.
 In addition, at the moment of their complete surrender to us, the Leaf Village,
 that wasn’t a very important issue any more.
 Leaf Village has no choice but to accept their surrender and proposition
 in order to restore national power.
 However, the current strength of Leaf Village has dropped drastically.
 Under these conditions,
 our top priority must be to prepare for any unpredicted crisis.
 We don’t know when any of the neighboring nations
 will come out in a bold move.
 Therefore, we’ve decided that until the village gets its strength back,
 we should assemble the top few men from each troop,
 and form an emergency executive committee to handle this.
 But first…
 we need a strong, trustworthy leader.
 You can find the seeds of trouble rolling around everywhere these days.
 It’s not just Orochimaru.
 You didn’t have to go through the trouble of informing me that.
 Well… I’ll continue gathering materials.
 I’m going to tell you the basic plan.
 We need the Fifth Hokage right away.
 And yesterday at an emergency meeting with the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,
 we decided it would be you, Jiraiya.
 I’m sorry, it’s not my nature.
 It has been decided.
 Besides, if a Shinobi like you, renowned as a Sannin, is not…
 then who is?
 If you want a Sannin, there is one more left…
 That Tsunade.
 Certainly that child probably has that capability, but…
 However, no one knows where she is.
 I’ll find and bring her back. lf I do that there’s no problem, right?
 But…
 A wise one like Tsunade is meant to be Hokage more than I, with no motivation.
 What do you want to do?
 All right. We’ll give it urgent consideration.
 However, we’ll have three members from Anbu Black Ops to accompany you
 as the search unit for Tsunade.
 Don’t worry, I won’t escape from this. The guards are not necessary.
 However…
 There is one guy that I want to take with me on my trip.
 I’ve found an interesting egg…
 What? That is absolutely strange.
 Sorry, but if you don’t have a ticket, there’s no ramen.
 No, wait a minute! I absolutely had one more.
 Huh?
 The one that I gave Konohamaru, was it the last?
 Welcome!
 Hey, my ramen!
 ""Racy Violence""
 Yo, you two!
 You seem to be getting along well.
 Fool, Anko asked me to buy rice dumplings. That’s all.
 What are you doing here?
 While I’m here to buy offerings, I’ve made plans to meet here…
 with Sasuke.
 Huh, it’s rare that you wait for people.
 Is the offering to Obito?
 Obito?
 Well…that’s about right.
 Kakashi, it’s strange for you to be here first.
 Well… once in a while.
 I don’t do natto (fermented beans) and sweet things.
 Oh… Is that so?
 What?!
 This is absolutely positively strange!
 You guys aren’t from the village… Why in the world did you come?
 I haven’t seen you for a while Asuma, Kurenai.
 If you know about us, are you former Leaf Shinobi?
 – Huh?! 					– Huh?!
 Y-You are?!
 Humph, without a doubt…
 Itachi…
 Uchiha.
 You are acquaintances of Itachi?
 If so…
 I’ll introduce myself as well.
 I’m Kisame Hoshigaki.
 Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.
 Never mind later, I’m going to beat you now!
 Itachi…
 It seems you’re pretty unpopular in the village too.
 I know you, too.
 Kisame Hoshigake,
 originally a Shinobi of Hidden Village in the Mist.
 Suspected of national covert activities and of killing a feudal lord,
 a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water, on the wanted list in all nations.
 You’re a major S-rank criminal listed in the Bingo Book.
 Itachi, you have some nerve coming back to this village
 after causing that awful incident.
 Asuma… Kurenai…
 Don’t interfere with me.
 I don’t intend to kill you.
 That’s not a line for you, who killed your comrades.
 I know there’s no way you’d come here
 without any clear purpose in those suspicious appearance.
 What are you after?
 This guy is pretty annoying. Should we kill him?
 It doesn’t look like we are able to leave the village so smoothly…
 But don’t overdo it, your techniques tend to stand out.
 They're done for then.
 This is…
 Genjutsu.
 Pressing down with the tip of his sword… What strength.
 My large sword, Shark Skin…
 doesn’t cut, but lops it off!
 Kurenai… You’re late.
 With this…
 it’s over!
 Genjutsu of that level doesn’t work on me.
 This is…Genjutsu Reversal?
 Kurenai!
 There’s no time to look away.
 That’s what’s expected from you, Kurenai.
 But…
 “But” this is as far as it goes…
 for you.
 What?!
 Water Style!
 – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu! – Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
 The same Jutsu as me?!
 Why have you shown up too?
 Well…I asked you to take care of them earlier.
 But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
 Shadow clones.
 Kakashi…
 Hatake.
 Cripes… So much fuss for nothing.
 I…
 I put it under my headband
 in order not to drop the important ticket during morning training.
 Okay, that’s fine… Eat well and do your best.
 Hmm?
 You’re going to do it again after this, right? Training?
 Of course! I’m full of motivation.
 Good! Here you go.
 Another serving for free! Go for it!
 Thank you, sir!
 Welcome.
 Just like I heard… I had to come and see it.
 It seems that you really are just eating ramen.
 Oh, Pervy Sage!
 A cycle of hardship, right?
 Inside, we were crying, right?
 But the one thing we won't give up is the dream we've chosen, right?
 It's a secondary role,
 a role in the shadows
 But in reaching for that dream,
 let us stay centered, let us stay true
 Over and over, we hung on without giving up
 Over and over, we kept coming back up
 Over and over, we believed and dreamed
 Over and over, we've seen fools
 Itachi Uchiha…
 who became a leader of Anbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen
 and who destroyed the Uchiha clan single-handedly.
 I don’t know why he has suddenly appeared after all this time…
 But I don’t think we will allow him to leave so easily.
 What is your purpose?!
 Next time: “Sharingan vs. Sharingan!”
